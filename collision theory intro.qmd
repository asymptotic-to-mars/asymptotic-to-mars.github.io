# Collision Theory

## What is a collision?

Two particles which the only relevant interaction is local when compared with interaction at long range, long range interaction is weak enough that the particles move with constant velocity. When these particles get close enough their straight line trajectories are changed, to this process we call a collision process. (See Sec. 10.6 Greg) In general collisions can give rise to chemical reactions and thus new particles described in general by: $$A_1+A_2\longrightarrow B_1 +B_2+B_3$$We will not deal with these types of reactions but of reactions where the identity of each particle is preserved, we call these scattering reactions. Schematically we have: $$A_1+A_2\longrightarrow A_1+A_2$$An interactions is elastic if none of internal degrees of freedom of the participants is changed during the process. (Cohen Chap VIII A-1) The analysis of the collision process between two particles can be done exactly, by computing the trajectory of both particles from the initial conditions and using Newtons Laws. This can be done in any reference frame in particular either the Lab frame or the CM frame. We'll discuss both. We can also describe the collision process with statistics, where we attach a probability law to the final velocity vectors given initial ones. We want to focus in these notes on the connection between the rigorous approach and the statistics one.

$$\text{CM}\longrightarrow \text{Col. Cross section}\longrightarrow \text{Prob Law}\longrightarrow \text{averages}$$ The collision cross section is an intermediary quantity that occurs in the probability law (function composition)

# Basic Perquisites to Study Collisions

Consider a system composed of two particles with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ located at time $t$ at $\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\mathbf{r}_2$ measured wrt to some reference frame $\mathcal{O}$ of our choice.

## Center of Mass Position and Relative Position

The center of mass is given by the following formula:

$$
\mathbf{R} = \frac{m_1 }{M}\mathbf{r}_1 +\frac{m_2 }{M}\mathbf{r}_2\qquad M=m_1+m_2
$$ {#eq-cm}

a linear combination of the current positions weighted by the relative mass.

While the relative position, as the name suggests is just:

$$
\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{r}_2
$$

Both measured with respect to $\mathcal{O}$.

These two formulas allow us to compute the new generalized coordinates $\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{r}$ from $\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\mathbf{r}_2$. Inverting them we get:

$$
\begin{cases}
\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{R} +\frac{m_2}{M}\mathbf{r}\\
\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{R} -\frac{m_1}{M}\mathbf{r}
\end{cases}
$$ {#eq-r1r2} we choose the reference frame attach located at $\mathbf{R}$, i.e., we choose $\mathcal{O} = \mathcal{O}_{cm}$, then @eq-r1r2 becomes:

$$
\begin{cases}
\mathbf{r}_{1,cm} = \frac{m_2}{M}\mathbf{r}\\
\mathbf{r}_{2,cm} =  -\frac{m_1}{M}\mathbf{r}
\end{cases}
$$ {#eq-r1r2cm}

where we introduce the subscript $cm$ to reminds us that the components of these vectors are with respect to the new frame; absence of subscript, like in $\mathbf{r}$ mean the components are with respect to the old reference frame.

## Total Momentum

The total linear momentum of the particles is the sum of the momentum of particle $1$ and $2$. This quantity is related with $\mathbf{R}$ as we see:

$$
\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{p}_1+\mathbf{p}_2=m_1\dot{\mathbf{r}}_1+m_2\dot{\mathbf{r}}_2=M\dot{\mathbf{R}}
$$ {#eq-2ndlaw}

Differentiating we find:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{P}} = \mathbf{F}_{1,tot}+\mathbf{F}_{2,tot}=M\ddot{\mathbf{R}}
$$

The total force on $1$ can be split into a sum of the external forces acting on $1$ plus the force $2$ does on $1$, similar split is done for the particle $2$. Since internal forces cancel, we know $\mathbf{F}_{1,tot}+\mathbf{F}_{2,tot}=\mathbf{F}_{ext,tot}$. We conclude:

$$
\mathbf{F}_{ext,tot}=M\ddot{\mathbf{R}}
$$ This formula has a very important consequence:

1.  If the external forces are zero then the acceleration of the center of mass is zero.
2.  If the acceleration of the center of mass is zero, then its velocity is zero or constant.
3.  If the center of mass velocity is zero or constant, then a reference frame attach to it $\mathcal{O}_{cm}$ is an inertial reference frame.

The frame $\mathcal{O}_{cm}$ will be a useful definition when studying collisions. Because in this frame the components of velocity of the center of mass are zero $\dot{\mathbf{R}}_{cm}=\mathbf{0}$ and as a result by @eq-2ndlaw we have:

$$
\begin{align}
&\mathbf{p}_1+\mathbf{p}_2=\mathbf{0}\\
\implies & \mathbf{p}_1=-\mathbf{p}_2
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-stat_on_p}

Moreover, in this new frame the measurements of $\dot{\mathbf{r}}_1$ and $\dot{\mathbf{r}}_2$ become using @eq-r1r2cm :

$$ \begin{cases} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{1,cm} = \frac{m_2}{M}\dot{\mathbf{r}}\\ \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{2,cm} =  -\frac{m_1}{M}\dot{\mathbf{r}} \end{cases} $$

which leads us to explicit formulas for the linear momentum:

$$
\begin{cases}
\mathbf{p}_{1,cm} = m_1 \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{1,cm} = \mu\dot{\mathbf{r}}\\
\mathbf{p}_{2,cm} = m_2 \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{2,cm} = -\mu\dot{\mathbf{r}}
\end{cases}
$$ {#eq-p1cmp2cm}

As expected they satisfy the equation @eq-stat_on_p .

## Kinetic Energy

The total kinetic energy of the particles is the sum of the kinetic energies, using the usual formulas we have wrt to any $\mathcal{O}$:

$$
T = \frac{1}{2} m_1 \dot{\mathbf{r}}_1+\frac{1}{2} m_2 \dot{\mathbf{r}}_2
$$

As we have seen in @eq-r1r2, from $\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\mathbf{r}_2$ we can compute the generalized coordinates $\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{r}$. Differentiating, relates the velocities:

$$
\begin{cases}
\dot{\mathbf{r}}_1 = \dot{\mathbf{R}} +\frac{m_2}{M}\dot{\mathbf{r}}\\
\dot{\mathbf{r}}_2 = \dot{\mathbf{R}} -\frac{m_1}{M}\dot{\mathbf{r}}
\end{cases}
$$

These equations are valid for velocities measured wrt to any $\mathcal{O}$ of our choice, they are general.

Substituting in $T$ we find:

$$
T = \frac{1}{2} M\dot{\mathbf{R}}^2+\frac{1}{2} \mu\dot{\mathbf{r}}^2\qquad \mu = \frac{m_1m_2}{M}
$$ {#eq-equivalent_K}

The total kinetic energy of $1$ plus $2$ at time $t$ measured wrt to $\mathcal{O}$ is equal to the sum of the kinetic energy of a massive particle $M$ moving with velocity $\dot{\mathbf{R}}$ plus a smaller particle $\mu$ moving with velocity $\dot{\mathbf{r}}$, both again, measured wrt to $\mathcal{O}$.

The energy in @eq-equivalent_K is NOT the kinetic energy wrt to $\mathcal{O}_{cm}$, it is just another way of computing the kinetic energy wrt to $\mathcal{O}$. Note that both $\dot{\mathbf{R}}$ and $\dot{\mathbf{r}}$ have components with respect with the frame of reference.

If we choose the $\mathcal{O}_{cm}$ frame of reference then $\dot{\mathbf{r}}_1$ and $\dot{\mathbf{r}}_2$ in @eq-r1r2cm become:

$$
\begin{cases}
\dot{\mathbf{r}}_{1,cm} = \frac{m_2}{M}\dot{\mathbf{r}}\\
\dot{\mathbf{r}}_{2,cm} =  -\frac{m_1}{M}\dot{\mathbf{r}}
\end{cases}
$$

These formulas are specific for velocities measured wrt center of mass reference frame.

The total kinetic energy as measured in $\mathcal{O}_{cm}$ becomes after simplifying:

$$
T_{cm} = \frac{1}{2} m_1 \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{1,cm}+\frac{1}{2} m_2 \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{2,cm} =  \frac{1}{2}\mu \dot{\mathbf{r}}^2
$$

## Elastic Collisions

Our goal is to describe the momenta and kinetic energy in a two particle elastic collision. If we assume there is no external forces acting on the particles the center of mass position moves at constant velocity and therefore constitute a inertial reference frame $\mathcal{O}_{cm}$. This is the first point of view we'll adopt. The second point of view is a special case of a lab reference frame - the conventional lab frame for collisions - it is set in such a way that particle $2$, the target is initially at rest. I would like to emphasize the key word initially at rest, that means that in the reference frame, after the collision, the particle $2$ is no longer at rest.

See Fig. 14.14 Taylor

-   In $\mathcal{O}_{cm}$ the initial and final momenta of both particles is given by @eq-p1cmp2cm

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \mathbf{p}_{1,cm} = -\mathbf{p}_{2,cm} \equiv \mathbf{p}_{cm}= \mu \dot{\mathbf{r}}\\
    \mathbf{p}_{1,cm}' = -\mathbf{p}_{2,cm}' \equiv \mathbf{p}_{cm}'=\mu \dot{\mathbf{r}}'
    \end{align}
    $$ {#eq-p1cmp2cmB}

-   In $\mathcal{O}_{lab}$ we find

    $$
    \begin{align}
    &\mathbf{p}_{1,lab} =\lambda \mathbf{p}+\mathbf{p}\\
    &\mathbf{p}_{1,lab}' = \lambda \mathbf{p}+\mathbf{p}'\qquad \lambda =\frac{m_1}{m_2}\\
    &\mathbf{p}_{2,lab}=\mathbf{p}'_{2,lab}=\mathbf{0}
    \end{align}
    $$

    proof: In this reference frame, $\mathbf{p}_{1,lab} =m_1 \dot{\mathbf{r}}_1$ which when written in generalized coordinates of center of mass plus relative distance become:

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \mathbf{p}_{1,lab} &=m_1 \dot{\mathbf{r}}_1\\
    &=m_1(\dot{\mathbf{R}}+\frac{m_2}{M}\dot{\mathbf{r}})\\
    &=m_1\dot{\mathbf{R}}+\mu\dot{\mathbf{r}}
    \end{align}
    $$ {#eq-p1labp2lab}

Now, for particle $2$ we also write $\mathbf{p}_{2,lab} =m_2 \dot{\mathbf{r}}_2$, but since this particle is at rest in the lab frame we have $\mathbf{p}_{2,lab}=\mathbf{0}$. Additionally, from the definition of center of mass @eq-cm we simplify @eq-p1labp2lab using the observation that:

$$
\begin{cases}
\dot{\mathbf{R}} = \frac{m_1}{M}\dot{\mathbf{r}}_1=\frac{m_1}{M}\dot{\mathbf{r}} =\frac{\mu}{m_2}\dot{\mathbf{r}}=\frac{\mathbf{p}}{m_2}\\
\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{r}_1
\end{cases}
$$ {#eq-R_before}

where at the last step we used @eq-p1cmp2cmB; the momentum $\mathbf{p}$ is of a fictitious particle with mass $\mu$. Substituting this result in @eq-p1labp2lab we find:

$$
\mathbf{p}_{1,lab} = m_1\dot{\mathbf{R}}+\mu\dot{\mathbf{r}}=\lambda \mathbf{p}+\mathbf{p}\qquad \lambda =\frac{m_1}{m_2}
$$

The momentum of $1$ after collision has the same form as @eq-p1labp2lab :

$$
\mathbf{p}'_{1,lab}=m_1\dot{\mathbf{R}}'+\mu\dot{\mathbf{r}}'
$$ {#eq-p1_after}

Observe that $\mu \dot{\mathbf{r}}'=\mathbf{p}'$; since $\mathbf{F}_{1,ext}=\mathbf{0}$ then $M\dot{\mathbf{R}} = M\dot{\mathbf{R}}'$, which means the velocity of the center of mass is the same before and after the collision and as a result we can compute it using @eq-R_before:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{R}}' = \dot{\mathbf{R}}=\frac{\mathbf{p}}{m_2}
$$

Substituting in @eq-p1_after yields:

$$
\mathbf{p}_{1,lab}' = \lambda \mathbf{p}+\mathbf{p}'\qquad \lambda =\frac{m_1}{m_2}
$$

The momentum of particle $2$ after the collision is computed as:

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbf{p}_{2,lab}' &= \mathbf{p}_{1,lab}+\mathbf{p}_{2,lab}-\mathbf{p}_{1,lab}'\\
&=\lambda \mathbf{p}+\mathbf{p}+\mathbf{0}-\lambda \mathbf{p}-\mathbf{p}'\\
&=\mathbf{p}-\mathbf{p}'
\end{align}
$$

We further find that for this particular lab frame where $2$ is at rest:

$$
T_{lab}=\frac{M}{m_2}T_{cm}
$$

proof: The kinetic energy after the collision is the sum of kinetic energies of both particles, particle $2$ this time has nonzero kinetic energy, we can prove that this sum yields the result above, although an easier way is to notice that kinetic energy is conserved since the collision is elastic and computing the kinetic energy before the collision (when particle $2$ is still at rest) is simple:

$$
\begin{align}
T_{lab}&=\frac{\mathbf{p}_{1,lab}^2}{2 m_1}+\frac{\mathbf{p}_{2,lab}^2}{2 m_2}\\
&=\frac{(\lambda \mathbf{p}+\mathbf{p})^2}{2m_1}+\mathbf{0}\\
&=\frac{(\lambda +1)^2}{2m_1}\mathbf{p}^2+\mathbf{0}\\
&=\frac{((m_1+m_2)/m_2)^2}{2m_1}\mathbf{p}^2\\
&=\frac{m_1}{2\mu^2}\mathbf{p}^2\\
&=\frac{M}{m_2}T_{cm}
\end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
T&=\frac{\mathbf{p}_{1,lab}'^2}{2 m_1}+\frac{\mathbf{p}_{2,lab}'^2}{2 m_2}\\
&=\frac{(\lambda \mathbf{p}+\mathbf{p}')^2}{2m_1}+\frac{(\mathbf{p}-\mathbf{p}')^2}{2m_2}\\
&=
\end{align}
$$

## Inelastic Collisions

In special relativity we know that the relativistic energy of a moving particle is given by:

$$
E = p_4c=\gamma m c^2\sim m c^2 +\frac{1}{2}m v^2\qquad v\ll c
$$

The limit being called the non-relativistic regime.

Consider a collision between two particles $1$ and $2$. If the system is isolated then there is conservation of four-momentum which implies conservation of relativistic energy, because this is the fourth component of four-momentum. In the non-relativistic regime the conservation of energy is:

$$
\begin{align}
&m_1^ic^2+\frac{1}{2}m_1^i(v_1^i)^2+m_2^ic^2+\frac{1}{2}m_2^i(v_2^i)^2 \\
&=m_1^fc^2+\frac{1}{2}m_1^f(v_1^f)^2+m_2^fc^2+\frac{1}{2}m_2^f(v_2^f)^2
\end{align}
$$

which is equivalent to:

$$
\begin{align}
&\overbrace{(m_1^i+m_2^i)}^{M^i}c^2+\overbrace{\frac{1}{2}m_1^i(v_1^i)^2+\frac{1}{2}m_2^i(v_2^i)^2}^{T^i} \\
&=\underbrace{(m_1^f+m_2^f)}_{M^f}c^2+\underbrace{\frac{1}{2}m_1^f(v_1^f)^2+\frac{1}{2}m_2^f(v_2^f)^2}_{T^f}
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-rel_E_conserv_law}

If we assume, as we do in classical mechanics, that the mass of particles does not change then mass-energy terms cancel and the equality above reduces to:

$$
T^i=T^f
$$

The kinetic energy is conserved and we call it an elastic collision.

In an inelastic collision such as a collision between two atoms their internal energy (mass-energy terms) can be disturbed and as a result their kinetic energies before and after cannot be the same $T^i\not = T^f$, as a result from @eq-rel_E_conserv_law, the masses before and after cannot be the same $M^i \not = M^f$.

If relativistic energy is conserved, then the mass cannot be conserved. When an atom gains internal energy, it gains mass.

The following formula @eq-rel_E_conserv_law is equivalent to:

$$
Q\equiv \Delta M c^2 =-\Delta T
$$

Here are some cases:

-   In an exothermic reaction $\Delta T >0$, thus $\Delta M<0$, the total rest mass of products of the reaction is smaller than the total mass of the reactants.

-   In an endothermic reaction the scenario signs are reversed.

-   In an elastic collision then $\Delta T =0$ and as we have discussed the rest mass is unchanged $\Delta M =0$.

-   Excitation reaction:

    $$
    e + Hg\longrightarrow e+Hg^*
    $$

    The electron does not change its mass due the collision because it has no internal structure, the mercury atom increases its quantum energy by $4.9eV$, it becomes an excited atom. The kinetic energy of the emerging particles is smaller by $4.9eV$, we write $\Delta T = -4.9 eV$, thus:

    $$
    \begin{align}
    &[(m^f_e+m^f_{Hg})-(m^i_e+m^i_{Hg})]c^2 = -\Delta T = 4.9 eV\\
    \implies &[m^f_{Hg}-m^i_{Hg}]=\frac{4.9 eV}{c^2}=8.7\times 10^{-36}kg
    \end{align}
    $$

## Using Binomial to describe a collision

When a particle $A_1$ moves toward $A_2$ either it collides or not depending on the parameters $b$ and $\sigma$. Since I do not know $b$, neither I know the nature of the interaction process, let us fill the vacuum with assumptions on what is going on. We can either make assumptions on the nature of the one interaction between two particles and then derive the resulting trajectory. Or I could make assumption on what I think would happen if the scattering process is repeated many times or instead I could make assumption on the process on scattering of one $A_1$ and many $A_2$. For the latter assume $A_2$ particles are uniformly distributed in space. If $N_1$ particles where send one by one (or at once) toward $N_2$ particles, the $A_1$ particle would see a density $n_2$.

![](figs/Pasted%20image%2020221022222836.png){width="412"}

and for each $A_1$ incoming we would have a Bernoulli trial with probability: $$p(\text{hit one $A_2$})=\frac{N_2 \sigma}{A}=n_2\sigma$$Note that the cross section $\sigma$ describes only whether a particle $A_2$ is hit or not, and does not care about the direction of the scattered $A_1$. Later we'll define a new quantity the scattering cross section which also takes into account this direction.

As a result we have the Binomial probability law on the random variable $X=[x \,\,\text{particles hit}]$: $$P(X=x)=\binom{N_1}{x}p^x(1-p)^{N_1-x} $$ The expected value of this r.v. is: $$E[X]=N_1 p = N_1 n_2 \sigma$$ which we rename as $N_{sc}$ just as Taylor does in formula (14.2) of Chap. 14, also we rename $N_{inc}:=N_1$, $n_{tar} :=n_2$:

$$
N_{sc}= N_{inc}n_{tar} \sigma
$$ {#eq-sc}

A schematic situation is shown in the following picture

![](figs/Pasted%20image%2020221023105348.png){width="248"}

This diagram is a sequence of $N$ Bernoulli trials which are in turn characterized by the parameter $p$, to the attached the Binomial probability law. Mathematically the diagram shows a sequence of trials which can succeed or not. Physically each trial can be interpreted as we want, the probability law is the same formula. For example, each branch can be seen as a trial for hit or miss of $N=3$ incoming particles toward a uniformly distributed set of target particles which yield a probability of hit given by $n_2\sigma$. Another example is consider just one incoming particle toward the targets and each trial describes an encounter which can result in a hit or miss. Either way the Bernoulli formula remains exactly the same.

## Commentary

The two examples focus on a vertical and horizontal slices of an ensemble. In the horizontal slice view, we have one incoming particle and $N_1$ trials (for $t$ seconds) with probability of hit given by $p$. In this case $P(X=x)$ should be interpreted as the probability of the same molecule collide $x$ times in $N$ trials. In particular $P(X=1)$ is the probability that one particle collides just once in $N_1$ trials. $P(X=1)$ does NOT mean the probability that one particle survives $N_1-1$ times and then collides at the $N_1$ trial, this probability would be given by $p(1-p)^{N_1-1}$ just as written in p. 466 of Reif.

## Different processes and Targets

When $A_1$ collides with $A_2$ other processes can occur:

-   It is scattered into a new direction, the effective area of $A_2$ that causes this effect is called $\sigma_{sc}$ (it is the $\sigma$ seen above. This process can occur elastically, in this case, the kinetic energy of $A_1$is unchanged and so it the internal energy (mass-energy); or can occur inelatically, in this case the kinetic energy changes. We can introduce this distinction as:

    $$
    \sigma_{sc}=\sigma_{el}+\sigma_{inel}
    $$

-   It is absorbed, if we imagine $A_1$ hitting the region of $A_2$ that is like putty, then $A_1$ becomes part of $A_1$, it is absorbed. In this case we define the effective region responsible for this effect as $\sigma_{cap}$ and the relation between the incoming particles and those absorbed is

    $$
    N_{cap} = N_{inc} n_{tar} \sigma_{cap}
    $$

-   It ionizes, in this case we define $\sigma_{ion}$.

**Example:** When an electron hits a chlorine atom, it can either be scattered into a new direction, be absorbed (chlorine can absorb an extra electron) or be ionized (one electron from chlorine is removed). The overall relation is:

$$
N_{tot}= N_{inc}n_{tar}\sigma_{tot} \qquad \sigma_{tot} = \overbrace{\sigma_{el}+\sigma_{inel}}^{\sigma_{sc}}+\sigma_{cap}+\sigma_{ion}
$$

Each one of these effective cross section depends on the kinetic energy of the inc electron, for example:

$$
\sigma_{ion}=
\begin{cases}
\text{positive }\qquad &T_{inc}\geq E_{ionization}\\
0\qquad &T_{inc}<E_{ionization}
\end{cases}
$$

The energy of ionization is the energy (eigenvalue) is the energy of the outermost electron (wave function with largest radius)

## Using Poisson distribution to describe collisions

If we assume we send each one of $N_1$ particles each $dt$ seconds (i.e. this is just a way to guarantee each incoming particle does not interact with each other) and make $N_1$ larger and larger while $p$ is fixed, the Bernoulli distribution formula is the same as above, but the expected value gets also larger and larger; this is one way to compute the limit distribution, lets see another, more useful one. Take the limit of $N_1$ while keeping the average value constant instead. Pictorially we have:

![A particle is sent each dt seconds, either it hits or misses the array of targets. In t seconds it is sent N=infinity particles.](figs/Pasted%20image%2020221023111809.png){width="460"}

Define now the r.v. $X=x \,\,\text{particles hit in $t$ seconds}$, then using the Binomial prob law we find: $$P(X=x)=\binom{N_1}{x}p^x\left(1-p\right)^{N_1-x}$$ The expected value is $E[X]= p N_1$. We would like to take now $N_1\rightarrow \infty$, but this entails the expected value to go to infinity if we assume $p$ constant. For the present scenario a better model is to assume the expected value is constant, i.e., we expect in any $t$ seconds to find on average the same number of hits. To fix the expected value lets rename it as the product $w t$. Hence let us introduce the quantity $w$ such that: $$w t\coloneqq N_1 p =N_1 dt\, w$$ As a consequence of fixing the average value though the fix of $w$ we find as a side effect: $$p(\text{hit between $t$ and $t+dt$})\coloneqq w dt =\frac{n_2\sigma}{t}dt$$ We see now that $w$ is the probability of hit per unit time. And $dt=t/N_1$. As a result the probability law is given by $$P(X=x)=\binom{N_1}{x}\left(\frac{w t}{N_1}\right)^x\left(1-\frac{w t}{N_1}\right)^{N_1-x}$$ The expected value is fix at $E[X]= p N_1=w t$ in this limit.

## Commentary

\_We need not define the expected value as $wt$, we could have just defined instead $E[X]\coloneqq \lambda$ and fix $\lambda$, this is done in Sec. 3.8 of Wackerly. Setting it to $wt$ was just a psychologically convenient way to make the parameter $t$ appear in the equation. Note the Poisson distribution depends on $wt$ and not on $t$ or $w$ alone.
:::

Having established all parameters and their dependencies and what is constant, we only have one independent variable in the probability law. Taking the limit as $N_1$ goes to infinity we arrive at: $$P(X=x)=\frac{(w t)^x}{x!}e^{-w t}$$ Which is the Poisson distribution. But what does it mean? Going back to the diagram above, we have an infinite number of trials between $0$ and $t$ seconds with a small probability $p$, we can interpret them by imagining a set of infinite particles incoming to an uniformly distributed set of target particles each branch the correspond to the trial of a given particle; note how this interpretation is not good, because we would guess that the probability for each hit or miss is finite and not the small number $n_2\sigma dt/t$. Let us consider a second interpretation, one particle incoming toward the targets and at each trial (which occurs in $dt$ seconds) decides whether it hit or miss, with probability that must ensure the macroscopic observed value of $wt$ hits in $t$ seconds. Under this last interpretation, $P(X=0)$ is $e^{-w t}$ is the probability of that particle suffering no collisions in $t$ seconds at the collision rate $w$. $P(X=1)=wt e^{-w t}$ is the probability that the one incoming particle to collide once in $t$ seconds, but it takes into account, see $wt$ (represented by the binomial coefficient in Bernoulli) the fact that the collision can occur at any time during those $t$ seconds.

Notice that $P(X=1)$ does NOT mean it survives every trial between $0$ and $t$ and then collides. That quantity is computed in p. 466 and 467 of Reif. and here is the gist of it, fixing the particular branch described by $$\overbrace{tt\dots tth}^N$$where t=miss and h= hit. We know that it has probability $(1-p)^{N-1}p$ of occurring (it is the \[\[Bernoulli process#\^b9ae87\|Geometric distribution\]\]), we are not interested in any other sequence of hits and misses other than $tt \dots h$, hence we did not take into account the $\binom{N}{1}$ factor, substituting $p=w\,dt$: $$P(\text{survives for $N-1$ trials and then hit})=\left(1-w\,dt\right)^{N-1}w\, dt=\left(1-\frac{wt}{N}\right)^{N-1}w \frac{t}{N}$$ this probability law (for this fixed branch) only depends on $t$ and $N$, but taking the limit of $N\longrightarrow \infty$ while $w$ is constant we get $$P(\text{survives for $t$ seconds and then hit})=e^{-wt}w\,dt$$ which depends only on $t$; this is the \[\[Bernoulli Process vs Poisson Process\|Exponential Distribution\]\] its the one derived by Reif. in Sec. 12.1. The expected value of r.v. $t$ is: $$E[t]=\int_0^\infty dt\,e^{wt}w t=\frac{1}{w}$$ which is also the characteristic decay of the probability law.

# Differential Cross Section

The area $\sigma_{sc}$ of $A_2$is large and depending on where $A_1$ hits, it can be scattered in various direction, the mathematical quantity that better suits the specification of this direction is the solid angle $d\Omega$ whose direction is $(\theta,\phi)$.

What subarea $d\sigma_{sc}$ of $\sigma_{sc}$ led to scattering of the incoming $A_1$ into the direction $d\Omega$. The simplest relation between this two quantities is the proportionality relation:

$$
d\sigma_{sc} = \frac{d\sigma_{sc}}{d\Omega}d\Omega
$$

The proportionality constant is called the scattering cross section, its meaning is derived from this formula, the ratio of the area that scatters into $(\theta,\phi)$ by the solid angle.

The number of scattered particles into the solid angle $d\Omega$ is computed as usual:

$$
dN_{sc} = N_{inc} n_{tar} d\sigma_{sc} = N_{inc} n_{tar}\frac{d\sigma_{sc}}{d\Omega}d\Omega
$$

This formula allow us to compute experimentally the scattering cross section and also gives meaning to it. We should note that it can also be derived theoretically.

Integrating all directions we recover the equation @eq-sc :

$$
N_{sc} = \int N_{inc} n_{tar}\frac{d\sigma_{sc}}{d\Omega}d\Omega = N_{inc} n_{tar}\overbrace{\int\frac{d\sigma_{sc}}{d\Omega}d\Omega}^{\sigma_{sc}}
$$

## Example of a theoretical calculation of the differential scattering cross-section

Collision between two billiard balls. Assumptions:

1.  Both are spherical, therefore the scattering cross-section is independent of $\phi$
2.  Using 1. We already used the Hamiltonian (EC+EP) to compute $b(\theta)$ (depending on the potential energy of interaction between the particle we have different functions $b$.

The function $b(\theta)$ tell us what position $A_1$ must have so that it land in the solid angle:

$$
d\Omega'=\int_0^{2\pi}(\sin \theta \,d\theta) \,\,d\phi = 2\pi \sin\theta\, d\theta
$$

Fixing $\theta$, i.e., fixing the ring, tell us the $b$ and thus the area of $A_2$ that $A_1$ must hit into land in this ring. The area is:

$$
d\sigma_{sc} = 2\pi b\,\,db
$$

The ratio of this area and the solid angle yields the scattering cross section:

$$
\frac{d\sigma_{sc}}{d\Omega'}=\frac{b}{\sin \theta}\left|\frac{db}{d\theta}\right|
$$
