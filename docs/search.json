    "text": "Polynomials are the simplest functions we can study and are an ideal arena to put into practice the two key views on functions:\nRelation Point of View and Procedure Point of View\nSurprisingly these are not well understood by many students, even those in college.\n\n\nWe begin this section by giving four examples of polynomial functions:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}&\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\,|\\,\\, y=100\\}\\\\&\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\,|\\,\\, y=3x+1\\}\\\\&\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\,|\\,\\, y=x^2+3\\}\\\\&\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\,|\\,\\, y=2x^3-x^2+0x+1\\}\\end{align}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nHow should we interpret this notation?\n\nThese are sets because they appear between \\(\\{\\) and \\(\\}\\).\nstating that \\((x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\), just translates into “ordered pairs of reals are entities of this set”.\nthe bar \\(|\\) , reads as “such that”, after which we write some rule that we which this ordered pairs to have.\nTo interpret the notation as a whole now, take \\(\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\,|\\,\\, y=3x+1\\}\\). We read is as a “set that contains ordered reals, such that they obey the equation \\(y=3x+1\\)”. As an example, the pair \\((1.3,2.9)\\) obeys the equation because \\(2.9 = 3\\times 1.3 +1\\) is true, therefore it belong to the set, but \\((1,3)\\) does not since \\(3=3\\times 1 +1\\) is false.\n\nEach rule in Equation 1 allow us to compute from a given \\(x\\) a unique value \\(y\\). As an example, chose \\(x=0\\) and plug in \\(y=3x+1\\), we get, not surprisingly, just the number \\(y=1\\), we do not get other possibility; in fact the same would be observed for any \\(x\\) we choose. This guarantees that each possible value of \\(y\\) does not appear twice or more within the set. In such situation we have in our hands more than a set, we have a function! In other words, the calculation \\(3x+1\\) for a specific \\(x\\) is a unique number which is associated with \\(x\\), we associate both numbers by writing \\((x,3x+1)\\), for example when we set \\(x=10\\) we get \\(y=31\\), we pair these numbers as \\((10,31)\\); every first entry \\(x\\) of the order pairs \\((x,y)\\) is always assigned (second entry) to just one number, namely the number \\(3x+1\\).\nObservation of the right hand side of the rules in Equation 1 show they are all some combination of a power of \\(x\\) times some number (positive or negative), the jargon for this is to say we have a linear combination of powers of \\(x\\). From Equation 1 we conclude the general form of these rules (equations) is:\n\\[\ny=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\dots+a_1 x+a_0\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere the coefficients are labeled by \\(a_0\\) through \\(a_n\\) are reals.\nThe truth set of the statement Equation 2 is the function:\n\\[\nP_n := \\{(x,y)\\in X\\times Y\\,\\,|\\,\\, y=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\dots+a_1 x+a_0\\}\n\\]\nWhich reads: from the pairs in the Cartesian product of the set \\(X\\) with the set \\(Y\\) we choose only the elements such that the rule \\(y=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\dots+a_1 x+a_0\\) is obeyed; it is useful to think about it as if we were choosing one by one the elements of \\(X\\times Y\\) which are of the form \\((x,y)\\) and then verifying whether that rules applies or not (True or False), see Figure 1 .\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Step by step construction of a polynomial function.\n\n\nThe highest power of \\(x\\) is \\(n\\) and is called the degree of the polynomial. We can and will use it to classify the polynomial functions, that is the reason why we decided to label the set by the symbol \\(P_n\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall\n\n\n\nA Cartesian product of the sets \\(X=\\{1,2,3\\}\\) and \\(Y=\\{4,5\\}\\) is defined as:\n\\[\nX\\times Y =\\{(1,4),(1,5),(2,4),(2,5),(3,4),(3,5)\\}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nRather then the view of Figure 1 on how to build the function \\(P_n\\) we adopt a slightly different strategy:\n\n\n\nFigure 2: An alternative way to construct a polynomial function.\n\n\nRather than to choose, test and verify each element of the Cartesian product we can instead choose from \\(X\\) the elements one by one and compute the corresponding \\(y\\) by the calculation \\(a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\dots+a_1 x+a_0\\); then we just include the so obtained ordered pair in the set \\(P_n\\). The perceptive in Figure 2 is expressed in mathematical notation as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\np_n:X&\\longrightarrow Y\\\\x &\\longmapsto p_n(x):= a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\dots+a_1 x+a_0\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nLets unpack what does this mean:\n\nOn the first row we find symbols that stand for:\nThe procedure labeled by the symbol \\(p_n\\) maps elements of \\(X\\) into elements in \\(Y\\)\nThis row of information immediately tells us what sets are involved, we can picture it as\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Sets involved in the construction of the function, as well as the name of procedure that maps elements of the first into the second. From the first row we still do not know how the map works, this is specified in the second row.\n\n\n\nThe second row explains many aspects of the procedure between these sets: the symbol \\(x\\) stands for a generic element of the set \\(X\\) while the symbol \\(p_n(x)\\) represents the element in \\(Y\\), which is assigned to \\(x\\) (notice the \\(\\mapsto\\) arrow), when the procedure \\(p_n\\) acts on it. Moreover, this row also tell us what is the element \\(p_n(x)\\), by telling what \\(p_n\\) does with the number \\(x\\)! The symbols:\n\\[\np_n(x):= a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\dots+a_1 x+a_0\n\\]\nmust now be understood: \\(a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\dots+a_1 x+a_0\\) has two meanings:\ni) is the LONG symbol for the number assigned to \\(x\\);\nii) it is a symbol that explains how \\(p_n\\) acts on \\(x\\) and get a number in \\(Y\\).\nMeanwhile \\(p_n(x)\\) is an abbreviation for it! It is the Short symbol for the calculation. The symbol \\(:=\\) means “by definition is equal to”.\n\n\nThe entire definition Equation 3 is the definition of a function, out of convince we name the function after the procedure, and refer to the function just as the “\\(p_n\\) function”. Observe that the symbol \\(p_n\\) is our choice, we can use any symbol as we wish, traditionally we use just one letter \\(f\\), \\(g\\), \\(h\\), etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\nThe largest domain supported by the procedure \\(p_n\\) is \\(X=\\mathbb{R}\\) irrespective of the degree \\(n\\), because with any real \\(x\\) we can do the calculation \\(p_n(x)\\); as usual the \\(Y\\) is the codomain and could either be chosen as \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) or the range of the function. The range of a function depends on the degree \\(n\\), being \\(\\mathbb{R}^+_0\\) if \\(n\\) is even and \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is \\(n\\) is odd integer.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the functions:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&F:=\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}\\,\\,|\\,\\,y=3x+1\\}\\\\\n&G:=\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}\\,\\,|\\,\\,y=2x^3-x^2+0x+1\\}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\ncan be written as\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nf:\\mathbb{R}&\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\\\\nx &\\longmapsto f(x):= 3x+1\n\\end{align}\n\\]and\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ng:\\mathbb{R}&\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\\\\nx &\\longmapsto g(x):= 2x^3-x^2+1\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe domain of \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) is \\(X=\\mathbb{R}\\) and the codomain is \\(Y=\\mathbb{R}\\) as we read from the \\(\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}\\).\nThe ranges requires us to compute \\(f(\\mathbb{R})\\) and \\(g(\\mathbb{R})\\), but since this requires tools not yet introduced in these notes, we will simply plot the functions we guess what we think the domain is:\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \nimport numpy as np\n\nxs = np.arange(-2.0, 2.1, 0.1)\n\nplt.figure()\nplt.subplot(211)\nplt.plot(xs, 3 * xs + 1, 'r-')\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('f(x)')\n\nplt.subplot(212)\nplt.plot(xs, 2 * xs**3 - xs + 1, 'b-')\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('g(x)')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that both functions increase/decrease without bound as \\(|x|\\) increases, thus the range is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) in both functions.\n\n\n\nDefine Equation 3 for the first and third function sets in Equation 1. Be careful in specifying what is the range of either function.\n\n\n\nFrom the set:\n\\[\n\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}\\,\\,|\\,\\, y=100\\}\n\\]\nwe identify the domain and codomain as the first and second sets in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}\\), thus the domain is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and the codomain is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) aswell. Meanwhile the range is just is \\(l(\\mathbb{R})=\\{100\\}\\). We can write this function using the procedure notation as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nl:\\mathbb{R}&\\longrightarrow \\{1\\}\\subset \\mathbb{R}\\\\\nx &\\longmapsto l(x):= 100\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe second function-set:\n\\[\n\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\,|\\,\\, y=x^2+3\\}\n\\]\nIs translated into:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nc:\\mathbb{R}&\\longrightarrow [3,+\\infty[\\subset \\mathbb{R}\\\\\nx &\\longmapsto c(x):= x^2+3\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe domain and range are both \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) again but the range is trickier. We want to compute the set \\(c(\\mathbb{R})\\), to do it, we note by inspecting \\(x^2+3\\) that its minimum value occurs when \\(x=0\\) and the larger the \\(x\\), the larger is \\(x^2+3\\), thus \\(c(\\mathbb{R})=[3,+\\infty[\\), which is a subset of the codomain \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \nimport numpy as np\n\nxs = np.arange(-2.0, 2.1, 0.1)\n\nplt.figure()\nplt.subplot(211)\nplt.plot(xs, np.ones([len(xs)]) * 100, 'r-')\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('l(x)')\n\nplt.subplot(212)\nplt.plot(xs, xs**2 + 3, 'b-')\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('g(x)')\nplt.show()"

The symbol \\(:=\\) means “by definition is equal to”.\n\n\nThe entire definition Equation 3 is the definition of a function, out of convince we name the function after the procedure, and refer to the function just as the “\\(p_n\\) function”. Observe that the symbol \\(p_n\\) is our choice, we can use any symbol as we wish, traditionally we use just one letter \\(f\\), \\(g\\), \\(h\\), etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\nThe largest domain supported by the procedure \\(p_n\\) is \\(X=\\mathbb{R}\\) irrespective of the degree \\(n\\), because with any real \\(x\\) we can do the calculation \\(p_n(x)\\); as usual the \\(Y\\) is the codomain and could either be chosen as \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) or the range of the function.

Recall the former notation is used for a generic angular momentum, not necessarily the orbital one.\n\n\nThe rhs of Equation 9 together with the choice of the position basis \\(\\{|x,y,z\\rangle\\}\\) allow us to give the position representation of the eigenvalue-eigenvector equations we saw in Equation 4:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\langle x,y,z|L^2\\ket{l,m}=l(l+1)\\hbar^2\\langle x,y,z|\\ket{l,m}\\\\\n&\\langle x,y,z|L_z\\ket{l,m}=m\\hbar\\langle x,y,z|\\ket{l,m}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{11}\\]\nSubstituting Equation 9 we find:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}&\\langle x,y,z|(L_x^2+L_y^2+L_z^2)\\ket{l,m}=l(l+1)\\hbar^2\\langle x,y,z|\\ket{l,m}\\\\\n&\\langle x,y,z|(XP_y-YP_x)\\ket{l,m}=m\\hbar\\langle x,y,z|\\ket{l,m}\\end{align}\n\\tag{12}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall\n\n\n\nThe \\(X\\) and \\(P_x\\) operators have the following representation in the \\(\\{|x\\rangle\\}\\) basis:\n\\[\n\\langle x|X|\\psi\\rangle = x\\langle x|\\psi\\rangle \\qquad \\langle x|P_x|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\langle x|\\psi\\rangle\n\\]\n\n\nThe second equation in Equation 12 we find:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\langle x,y,z|L_z|\\psi\\rangle &= \\langle x,y,z|(XP_y-YP_x)|\\psi\\rangle\\\\\n&= \\langle x,y,z|(xP_y-yP_x)|\\psi\\rangle\\\\\n&= \\langle x,y,z|(x\\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}-y\\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x})|\\psi\\rangle\\\\\n&= \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\left(x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}-y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right)\\langle x,y,z|\\psi\\rangle\\\\\n&= \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\left(x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}-y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right)\\psi(x,y,z)\n\\end{align}\n\\] Therefore, in the position basis, the \\(L_z\\) operator acts on functions \\(\\psi(x,y,z)\\) as the operation:\n\\[\nL_z \\rightsquigarrow \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\left(x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}-y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right)\n\\tag{13}\\]\nSimilarly we find:\n\\[\nL_x \\rightsquigarrow \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\left(y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}-z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right) \\qquad L_y \\rightsquigarrow \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\left(z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}-x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right)\n\\tag{14}\\]\nWe could substitute the rhs of Equation 13 and Equation 14 into the commutation relations and run an analogous calculation to Equation 10, the would conclude that they indeed satisfy those equations as well.\nIt will be useful to change from cartesian coordinates \\(x,y,z\\) into polar coordinates \\(r,\\theta,\\phi\\). The map between these coordinates is established by the equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& x = r \\sin \\theta \\cos \\phi\\\\\n& y = r \\sin \\theta \\sin \\phi\\\\\n& z = r \\cos \\theta\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nprovided \\(r\\geq 0\\), \\(0\\leq\\theta\\leq\\pi\\) and \\(0\\leq\\phi&lt; 2\\pi\\)\nTo convert Equation 13 and Equation 14 into polar coordinates we proceed as follows:\n\nDraw a diagram:\n\n\n\nRelate the derivatives in cartesian and polar coordinates encoded in the diagram:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\partial_r\\psi\\\\\n\\partial_\\theta\\psi\\\\\n\\partial_\\phi\\psi\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\partial_r x & \\partial_r y & \\partial_r z\\\\\n\\partial_\\theta x & \\partial_\\theta y & \\partial_\\theta z\\\\\n\\partial_\\phi x & \\partial_\\phi y & \\partial_\\phi z\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\partial_x\\psi\\\\\n\\partial_y \\psi\\\\\n\\partial_z \\psi\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\tag{15}\\]\n\nCompute the matrix (Easy)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi & \\sin\\theta \\sin \\phi & \\cos\\theta\\\\\nr \\cos\\theta \\cos\\phi & r \\cos\\theta \\sin \\phi & -r \\sin \\theta\\\\\n-r\\sin\\theta \\sin \\phi & r \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nInvert the system Equation 15 (Hard, use Mathematica)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\partial_x\\psi\\\\\n\\partial_y\\psi\\\\\n\\partial_z\\psi\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sin\\theta \\cos \\phi   & r^{-1}\\cos\\theta \\cos\\phi & -(r\\sin\\theta)^{-1} \\sin\\phi\\\\\n\\sin\\theta \\sin \\phi   & r^{-1}\\cos\\theta \\sin\\phi & (r\\sin\\theta)^{-1} \\cos\\phi\\\\\n\\cos\\theta & -r^{-1}\\sin\\theta & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\partial_r\\psi\\\\\n\\partial_\\theta \\psi\\\\\n\\partial_\\phi \\psi\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the results into Equation 13 and Equation 14 and simplify gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&L_x \\rightsquigarrow i\\hbar\\left(\\sin\\phi \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}+\\frac{\\cos\\phi}{\\tan\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\right)\\\\\n&L_y \\rightsquigarrow i\\hbar\\left(-\\cos\\phi \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}+\\frac{\\sin\\phi}{\\tan\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\right)\\\\\n&Lz \\rightsquigarrow \\frac{\\hbar}{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFrom these results we can now derive the action of \\(L^2\\) in polar coordinates:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nL^2\\psi &= L_x^2\\psi + L_y^2\\psi+L_z^2\\psi\\\\\n&=(i\\hbar)^2\\left(\\sin\\phi \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}+\\frac{\\cos\\phi}{\\tan\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\right)^2\\psi\n+(i\\hbar)^2\\left(-\\cos\\phi \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}+\\frac{\\sin\\phi}{\\tan\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\right)^2\\psi+\n\\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\phi^2}\\psi\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{16}\\] Now we need to expand each square, the first becomes:\n\n\\[\n(i\\hbar)^2\\left(\\sin^2\\phi \\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial \\theta^2}+ \\frac{\\cos^2\\phi}{\\tan^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial \\phi^2}-\\frac{\\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi}{\\sin^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\phi}+\\frac{\\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi}{\\tan\\theta}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial\\theta\\partial \\phi}\\right)\n\\]\nthe second term becomes:\n\\[\n(i\\hbar)^2\\left(\\cos^2\\phi \\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial \\theta^2}+ \\frac{\\sin^2\\phi}{\\tan^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial \\phi^2}+\\frac{\\cos\\phi\\sin\\phi}{\\sin^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\phi}-\\frac{\\cos\\phi\\sin\\phi}{\\tan\\theta}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial\\theta\\partial \\phi}\\right)\n\\]\nSubstituting into Equation 16 and canceling terms yields the final result:\n\\[\nL^2 \\rightsquigarrow -\\hbar^2\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\theta^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\theta} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\phi^2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan\\theta}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)\n\\tag{17}\\]\nAs a consequence, the system of equations in Equation 12 becomes a system of partial differential equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&-\\hbar^2 \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta^2}+\\frac{1}{\\tan \\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}+\\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial^2 \\phi^2}\\right)\\psi_{l,m}(r, \\theta, \\phi)=l(l+1)\\hbar^2\\psi_{l,m}(r, \\theta, \\phi)\\\\\n& \\frac{\\hbar}{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\psi_{l,m}(r, \\theta, \\phi)=m\\hbar \\psi_{l,m}(r, \\theta, \\phi)\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{18}\\]\nThe solutions \\(\\psi_{l,m}(r,\\theta,\\phi)\\) are the eigenfunctions common to the \\(L^2\\) and \\(L_z\\) operators associated with the eigenvalues \\(l(l+1)\\hbar^2\\) and \\(m\\hbar\\). These solution exist because these two operators commute. Our ultimate goal is to solve them, but in these notes we’ll content ourselves by just identifying some of its properties."
