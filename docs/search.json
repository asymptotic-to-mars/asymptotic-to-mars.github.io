    "text": "Polynomials are the simplest functions we can study and are an ideal arena to put into practice the two key views on functions:\n\nRelation Point of View\nProcedure Point of View\n\n\n\nUnder the relation perspective, we specify a function by listing all ordered pairs that make up its graph. Here are four examples of polynomial functions:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}&\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\,|\\,\\, y=100\\}\\\\&\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\,|\\,\\, y=3x+1\\}\\\\&\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\,|\\,\\, y=x^2+3\\}\\\\&\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\,|\\,\\, y=2x^3-x^2+0x+1\\}\\end{align}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nHow should we interpret this notation?\n\nThese are sets because they appear between \\(\\{\\) and \\(\\}\\).\nStating that \\((x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\), just says two things at once:\n\nthe elements of the set are ordered pairs \\((x,y)\\)\nthat \\(x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(y\\in \\mathbb{R}\\), in other words, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are reals.\n\nthe bar \\(|\\) we see in Equation 1, reads as “such that”, after which we write some rule/property/equation that we wish these ordered pairs of reals to have. For example the equation \\(y=100\\) is the rule we want for the first polynomial in Equation 1, therefore this function is composed by all ordered pairs \\((x,y)\\) with \\(y\\) equal to \\(100\\), while \\(x\\) ranges on all reals.\nTo interpret the notation as a whole, take \\(\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\,|\\,\\, y=3x+1\\}\\). We read is as a “set that contains ordered reals, such that they obey the equation \\(y=3x+1\\)”. As an example, the pair \\((1.3,2.9)\\) obeys the equation because \\(2.9 = 3\\times 1.3 +1\\) is true, therefore it belong to the set, but \\((1,3)\\) does not since \\(3=3\\times 1 +1\\) is false.\n\nThe equations we wrote after \\(|\\) allow us to compute from a given \\(x\\) a unique value \\(y\\). As an example of this fact, choose the equation of the second polynomial, \\(y=3x+1\\), plug in \\(x=0\\), what do we get? We get \\(y=3\\cdot 0 +1\\), that is, just the number \\(y=1\\). Notice we do not get other possible value for \\(y\\), we just get the \\(y=1\\), no other possibility; in fact the same happens for any other \\(x\\) we choose. This is such an obvious fact we actually skip by it. But it is important, because the fact that the equations in Equation 1 have that property ensures us that each possible value of \\(x\\) does not appear two or more times within these set. In such situation we have in our hands more than a set, we have a function!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommentary\n\n\n\nThe set \\(\\{(1,2),(1,3),(2,4)\\}\\) have \\(1\\) connected to \\(2\\) and \\(3\\), thus it is not a function. The set\\(\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\,|\\,\\, x\\in \\mathbb{R} \\land y\\in[2,3]\\}\\) have each real \\(x\\) connected to every real between \\(2\\) and \\(3\\), its also not a function. The set \\(\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\,|\\,\\, y^2=x^2\\}\\) is not a function, if I specify \\(x=1\\) then we get \\(y^2=1\\) whose solution is either \\(y=\\pm 1\\). Therefore we have two y-numbers \\(\\pm1\\) attached to \\(x=1\\).\nThese sets are not functions, but still, they make connections between the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) . Because they relate the values \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), we call these sets relations. Note that functions are also relations.\n\n\nObservation of the right hand side of the rules in Equation 1 show they are all some combination of a power of \\(x\\) times some number (positive or negative), the jargon for this is to say we have a linear combination of powers of \\(x\\). From Equation 1 we conclude the general form of these rules (equations) is:\n\\[\ny=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\dots+a_1 x+a_0\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere the coefficients are labeled by \\(a_0\\) through \\(a_n\\) are reals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall\n\n\n\nA Cartesian product of the sets \\(X=\\{1,2,3\\}\\) and \\(Y=\\{4,5\\}\\) is defined as:\n\\[\nX\\times Y =\\{(1,4),(1,5),(2,4),(2,5),(3,4),(3,5)\\}\n\\]\n\n\nThe truth set of the statement Equation 2 is the function:\n\\[\nP_n := \\{(x,y)\\in X\\times Y\\,\\,|\\,\\, y=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\dots+a_1 x+a_0\\}\n\\]\nWhich reads: from the pairs in the Cartesian product of the set \\(X\\) with the set \\(Y\\) we choose only the elements such that the rule \\(y=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\dots+a_1 x+a_0\\) is obeyed; it is useful to think about it as if we were choosing one by one the elements of \\(X\\times Y\\) which are of the form \\((x,y)\\) and then verifying whether that rules applies or not (True or False), see Figure 1 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Step by step construction of a polynomial function.\n\n\n\nThe highest power of \\(x\\) is \\(n\\) and is called the degree of the polynomial. We can and will use it to classify the polynomial functions, that is the reason why we decided to label the set by the symbol \\(P_n\\).\n\n\n\nRather then the view of Figure 1 on how to build the function \\(P_n\\) we adopt a slightly different strategy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: An alternative way to construct a polynomial function.\n\n\n\nRather than to choose, test and verify each element of the Cartesian product we can instead choose from \\(X\\) the elements one by one and compute the corresponding \\(y\\) by the calculation \\(a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\dots+a_1 x+a_0\\); then we just include the so obtained ordered pair in the set \\(P_n\\). The perceptive in Figure 2 is expressed in mathematical notation as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\np_n:X&\\longrightarrow Y\\\\x &\\longmapsto p_n(x):= a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\dots+a_1 x+a_0\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nLets unpack what does this mean:\n\nOn the first row we find symbols that stand for:\nThe procedure labeled by the symbol \\(p_n\\) maps elements of \\(X\\) into elements in \\(Y\\)\nThis row of information immediately tells us what sets are involved, we can picture it as\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Sets involved in the construction of the function, as well as the name of procedure that maps elements of the first into the second. From the first row we still do not know how the map works, this is specified in the second row.\n\n\n\n\\(X\\) is called the domain of the function, while \\(Y\\) is the codomain.\n\nThe second row explains many aspects of the procedure between these sets: the symbol \\(x\\) stands for a generic element of the set \\(X\\) while the symbol \\(p_n(x)\\) represents the element in \\(Y\\), which is assigned to \\(x\\) (notice the \\(\\mapsto\\) arrow), when the procedure \\(p_n\\) acts on it. This row also tell us what is the element \\(p_n(x)\\), by telling what \\(p_n\\) does with the number \\(x\\)! The string of symbols:\n\\[\np_n(x):= a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\dots+a_1 x+a_0\n\\]\nmust now be well understood:\ni) \\(a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\dots+a_1 x+a_0\\) is the LONG symbol for the element of \\(Y\\) which is assigned (connected) to \\(x\\);\nii) it is LONG because it explains how the number comes about. We usually abbreviate the LONG symbol by a short symbol such as \\(p_n(x)\\). The symbol \\(:=\\) means “by definition is equal to”.\n\n\nThe entire definition Equation 3 is the definition of a function, out of convince we name the function after the procedure, and refer to the function just as the “\\(p_n\\) function”. Observe that the symbol \\(p_n\\) is our choice, we can use any symbol as we wish, traditionally we use just one letter \\(f\\), \\(g\\), \\(h\\), etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\nThe largest domain supported by the procedure \\(p_n\\) is \\(X=\\mathbb{R}\\) irrespective of the degree \\(n\\), because with any real \\(x\\) we can do the calculation \\(p_n(x)\\); as usual the \\(Y\\) is the codomain and could either be chosen as \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) or the range of the function. The range of a function depends on the degree \\(n\\), being \\(\\mathbb{R}^+_0\\) if \\(n\\) is even and \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is \\(n\\) is odd integer.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the functions:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&F:=\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}\\,\\,|\\,\\,y=3x+1\\}\\\\\n&G:=\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^+\\times\\mathbb{R}\\,\\,|\\,\\,y=2x^3-x^2+0x+1\\}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe domain of \\(F\\) is \\(X=\\mathbb{R}\\) while that of \\(G\\) is \\(X=\\mathbb{R}^+\\), the codomains are both \\(Y=\\mathbb{R}\\).\nWe can rewrite the functions \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) using the procedure notation as\n\\[ \\begin{align} f:\\mathbb{R}&\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\\\ x &\\longmapsto f(x):= 3x+1 \\end{align}  \\tag{4}\\]\n\\[ \\begin{align} g:\\mathbb{R}^+&\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\\\ x &\\longmapsto g(x):= 2x^3-x^2+1 \\end{align} \\]\nThe range is the set of all outputs of a function, conveniently named by the symbols \\(f(\\mathbb{R})\\) and \\(g(\\mathbb{R})\\). What are these sets? Unfortunately, this requires tools not yet introduced in these notes, to circumvent that, we will simply plot the functions and guess what we think the range is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the outputs of the \\(F\\) function increase/decrease without bound as \\(x\\) increases, thus the range is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) in both functions. For the function \\(G\\), as \\(x\\) increase, the outputs do as well; observe \\(x\\) is never zero! Thus the range is \\(\\mathbb{R}^+\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommentary\n\n\n\nWhen one wishes to refer to functions defined as Equation 3 we simply say “the function \\(p_n(x)\\)”. For example if I want to say Equation 4 has property \\(A\\), then we should say “the function \\(f(x)\\) has property \\(A\\)” or more simply “the function \\(f\\) has property \\(A\\)” or “the function \\(3x+1\\) has property \\(A\\)” or even “the function \\(y=3x+1\\) has property \\(A\\)”. Even though the later are not accurate ( \\(f(x)\\) is a variable symbol, \\(f\\) labels the procedure and \\(y=3x+1\\) is an equation) we will still use it. We sacrifice a bit of accuracy for the sake of brevity.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine Equation 3 for the first and third function sets in Equation 1. Be careful in specifying what is the range of either function.\n\n\n\nFrom the set:\n\\[\n\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}\\,\\,|\\,\\, y=100\\}\n\\]\nwe identify the domain and codomain as the first and second sets in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}\\), thus the domain is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and the codomain is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) aswell. Meanwhile the range is just is \\(l(\\mathbb{R})=\\{100\\}\\). We can write this function using the procedure notation as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nl:\\mathbb{R}&\\longrightarrow \\{1\\}\\subset \\mathbb{R}\\\\\nx &\\longmapsto l(x):= 100\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe second function-set:\n\\[\n\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\,|\\,\\, y=x^2+3\\}\n\\]\nIs translated into:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nc:\\mathbb{R}&\\longrightarrow [3,+\\infty[\\subset \\mathbb{R}\\\\\nx &\\longmapsto c(x):= x^2+3\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe domain and range are both \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) again but the range is trickier. We want to compute the set \\(c(\\mathbb{R})\\), to do it, we note by inspecting \\(x^2+3\\) that its minimum value occurs when \\(x=0\\) and the larger the \\(x\\), the larger is \\(x^2+3\\), thus \\(c(\\mathbb{R})=[3,+\\infty[\\), which is a subset of the codomain \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)."

This row also tell us what is the element \\(p_n(x)\\), by telling what \\(p_n\\) does with the number \\(x\\)!

We usually abbreviate the LONG symbol by a short symbol such as \\(p_n(x)\\). The symbol \\(:=\\) means “by definition is equal to”.\n\n\nThe entire definition Equation 3 is the definition of a function, out of convince we name the function after the procedure, and refer to the function just as the “\\(p_n\\) function”. Observe that the symbol \\(p_n\\) is our choice, we can use any symbol as we wish, traditionally we use just one letter \\(f\\), \\(g\\), \\(h\\), etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\nThe largest domain supported by the procedure \\(p_n\\) is \\(X=\\mathbb{R}\\) irrespective of the degree \\(n\\), because with any real \\(x\\) we can do the calculation \\(p_n(x)\\); as usual the \\(Y\\) is the codomain and could either be chosen as \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) or the range of the function.

Recall the former notation is used for a generic angular momentum, not necessarily the orbital one.\n\n\nThe rhs of Equation 15 together with the choice of the position basis \\(\\{|x,y,z\\rangle\\}\\) allow us to give the position representation of the eigenvalue-eigenvector equations we saw in Equation 5:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\langle x,y,z|L^2\\ket{l,m}=l(l+1)\\hbar^2\\langle x,y,z|\\ket{l,m}\\\\\n&\\langle x,y,z|L_z\\ket{l,m}=m\\hbar\\langle x,y,z|\\ket{l,m}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{17}\\]\nSubstituting Equation 15 we find:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}&\\langle x,y,z|(L_x^2+L_y^2+L_z^2)\\ket{l,m}=l(l+1)\\hbar^2\\langle x,y,z|\\ket{l,m}\\\\\n&\\langle x,y,z|(XP_y-YP_x)\\ket{l,m}=m\\hbar\\langle x,y,z|\\ket{l,m}\\end{align}\n\\tag{18}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall\n\n\n\nThe \\(X\\) and \\(P_x\\) operators have the following representation in the \\(\\{|x\\rangle\\}\\) basis:\n\\[\n\\langle x|X|\\psi\\rangle = x\\langle x|\\psi\\rangle \\qquad \\langle x|P_x|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\langle x|\\psi\\rangle\n\\]\n\n\nThe second equation in Equation 18 we find:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\langle x,y,z|L_z|\\psi\\rangle &= \\langle x,y,z|(XP_y-YP_x)|\\psi\\rangle\\\\\n&= \\langle x,y,z|(xP_y-yP_x)|\\psi\\rangle\\\\\n&= \\langle x,y,z|(x\\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}-y\\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x})|\\psi\\rangle\\\\\n&= \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\left(x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}-y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right)\\langle x,y,z|\\psi\\rangle\\\\\n&= \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\left(x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}-y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right)\\psi(x,y,z)\n\\end{align}\n\\] Therefore, in the position basis, the \\(L_z\\) operator acts on functions \\(\\psi(x,y,z)\\) as the operation:\n\\[\nL_z \\rightsquigarrow \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\left(x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}-y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right)\n\\tag{19}\\]\nSimilarly we find:\n\\[\nL_x \\rightsquigarrow \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\left(y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}-z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right) \\qquad L_y \\rightsquigarrow \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\left(z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}-x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right)\n\\tag{20}\\]\nWe could substitute the rhs of Equation 19 and Equation 20 into the commutation relations and run an analogous calculation to Equation 16, the would conclude that they indeed satisfy those equations as well.\nIt will be useful to change from cartesian coordinates \\(x,y,z\\) into polar coordinates \\(r,\\theta,\\phi\\). The map between these coordinates is established by the equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& x = r \\sin \\theta \\cos \\phi\\\\\n& y = r \\sin \\theta \\sin \\phi\\\\\n& z = r \\cos \\theta\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nprovided \\(r\\geq 0\\), \\(0\\leq\\theta\\leq\\pi\\) and \\(0\\leq\\phi&lt; 2\\pi\\)\nTo convert Equation 19 and Equation 20 into polar coordinates we proceed as follows:\n\nDraw a diagram:\n\n\n\nRelate the derivatives in cartesian and polar coordinates encoded in the diagram:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\partial_r\\psi\\\\\n\\partial_\\theta\\psi\\\\\n\\partial_\\phi\\psi\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\partial_r x & \\partial_r y & \\partial_r z\\\\\n\\partial_\\theta x & \\partial_\\theta y & \\partial_\\theta z\\\\\n\\partial_\\phi x & \\partial_\\phi y & \\partial_\\phi z\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\partial_x\\psi\\\\\n\\partial_y \\psi\\\\\n\\partial_z \\psi\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\tag{21}\\]\n\nCompute the matrix (Easy)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi & \\sin\\theta \\sin \\phi & \\cos\\theta\\\\\nr \\cos\\theta \\cos\\phi & r \\cos\\theta \\sin \\phi & -r \\sin \\theta\\\\\n-r\\sin\\theta \\sin \\phi & r \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nInvert the system Equation 21 (Hard, use Mathematica)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\partial_x\\psi\\\\\n\\partial_y\\psi\\\\\n\\partial_z\\psi\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sin\\theta \\cos \\phi   & r^{-1}\\cos\\theta \\cos\\phi & -(r\\sin\\theta)^{-1} \\sin\\phi\\\\\n\\sin\\theta \\sin \\phi   & r^{-1}\\cos\\theta \\sin\\phi & (r\\sin\\theta)^{-1} \\cos\\phi\\\\\n\\cos\\theta & -r^{-1}\\sin\\theta & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\partial_r\\psi\\\\\n\\partial_\\theta \\psi\\\\\n\\partial_\\phi \\psi\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the results into Equation 19 and Equation 20 and simplify gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&L_x \\rightsquigarrow i\\hbar\\left(\\sin\\phi \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}+\\frac{\\cos\\phi}{\\tan\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\right)\\\\\n&L_y \\rightsquigarrow i\\hbar\\left(-\\cos\\phi \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}+\\frac{\\sin\\phi}{\\tan\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\right)\\\\\n&Lz \\rightsquigarrow \\frac{\\hbar}{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFrom these results we can now derive the action of \\(L^2\\) in polar coordinates:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nL^2\\psi &= L_x^2\\psi + L_y^2\\psi+L_z^2\\psi\\\\\n&=(i\\hbar)^2\\left(\\sin\\phi \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}+\\frac{\\cos\\phi}{\\tan\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\right)^2\\psi\n+(i\\hbar)^2\\left(-\\cos\\phi \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}+\\frac{\\sin\\phi}{\\tan\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\right)^2\\psi+\n\\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\phi^2}\\psi\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{22}\\] Now we need to expand each square, the first becomes:\n\n\\[\n(i\\hbar)^2\\left(\\sin^2\\phi \\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial \\theta^2}+ \\frac{\\cos^2\\phi}{\\tan^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial \\phi^2}-\\frac{\\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi}{\\sin^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\phi}+\\frac{\\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi}{\\tan\\theta}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial\\theta\\partial \\phi}\\right)\n\\]\nthe second term becomes:\n\\[\n(i\\hbar)^2\\left(\\cos^2\\phi \\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial \\theta^2}+ \\frac{\\sin^2\\phi}{\\tan^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial \\phi^2}+\\frac{\\cos\\phi\\sin\\phi}{\\sin^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\phi}-\\frac{\\cos\\phi\\sin\\phi}{\\tan\\theta}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial\\theta\\partial \\phi}\\right)\n\\]\nSubstituting into Equation 22 and canceling terms yields the final result:\n\\[\nL^2 \\rightsquigarrow -\\hbar^2\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\theta^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\theta} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\phi^2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan\\theta}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)\n\\tag{23}\\]\nAs a consequence, the system of equations in Equation 18 becomes a system of partial differential equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&-\\hbar^2 \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta^2}+\\frac{1}{\\tan \\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}+\\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial^2 \\phi^2}\\right)\\psi_{l,m}(r, \\theta, \\phi)=l(l+1)\\hbar^2\\psi_{l,m}(r, \\theta, \\phi)\\\\\n& \\frac{\\hbar}{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\psi_{l,m}(r, \\theta, \\phi)=m\\hbar \\psi_{l,m}(r, \\theta, \\phi)\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{24}\\]\nThe solutions \\(\\psi_{l,m}(r,\\theta,\\phi)\\) are the eigenfunctions common to the \\(L^2\\) and \\(L_z\\) operators associated with the eigenvalues \\(l(l+1)\\hbar^2\\) and \\(m\\hbar\\). These solution exist because these two operators commute. Our ultimate goal is to solve them, but in these notes we’ll content ourselves by just identifying some of its properties."

These coordinates are real functions of time.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: One dimensional oscilator box always wants to return to the equilibrium position. For small amplitudes \\(A\\), the spring force on the box is given by Hook’s law.\n\n\nThe total energy of the system: We want to obtain a formula for the total energy in terms of the system coordinates using classical theory since its most familiar to us.\nRecall it is the sum of the kinetic energy of the box, which has the usual form \\(p^2/2m\\), and the potential energy \\(v(x)\\) that characterizes the spring force. What function \\(v(x)\\) can possibly describe well such a system?\nNote the assumptions! We want to describe small oscillations, i.e., the deviation \\(x\\) from equilibrium must be really small, much smaller than 1, mathematically \\(|x|\\ll 1\\) or if you prefer, the limit as \\(x \\longrightarrow 0\\).\nWith this information in our hands we can do something wonderful; we can break \\(v(x)\\) in two parts: the relevant part and negligible one. Using the power of Taylor series we find:\n\\[ v(x) = \\overbrace{v(0) + v'(0)x + \\frac{1}{2}v''(0)x^2}^{Relevant}+\\mathcal{O}(x^3).  \\tag{1}\\]\nTo simplify \\(v(x)\\): the constant term \\(v(0)\\) is set to zero to simplify notation and since \\(v(x)\\) has a minimum at \\(x=0\\), \\(v'(0)=0\\) aswell. Additionally, we identify \\(v''(0)\\) as Hook constant \\(k\\) which, by the way, can be rewritten as \\(m\\omega^2\\), the \\(\\omega\\) is the characteristic frequency \\(\\omega\\) of an oscillator for which this approximation is valid.\nThis makes this formula pleasantly simple\n\\[\nv(x) \\sim \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 =\\frac{1}{2}m \\omega^2x^2\n\\tag{2}\\]\nPictorially, the rhs describes the parabola (pink) that better fits the original potential energy (blue).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The actual potential vs its approximation, valid when x is small.\n\n\nWhat have we achieved so far? We got the formula Equation 2 . Look at it as the functional form of any function that describes the potential energy as a function of \\(x\\) of an oscillator, oscillating :) with small amplitude. Small compared to what, small enough that the third order \\(\\mathcal{O}(x^3)\\) terms of the Taylor Equation 1 are negligible compared with \\(\\mathcal{O}(x^2)\\) term.\nThe total energy of the system is now one step away, its called the Hamiltonian \\(h\\) of the system as is (as usual) the sum of the kinetic energy plus potential energy which we express has:\n\\[\nh=\\frac{p^2}{2m}+\\frac{1}{2}m \\omega^2x^2.\n\\tag{3}\\]\nWith the classical mindset we could, if we wish, derive the laws of motion for this spring-box system using this Hamiltonian, these laws are:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dot{x} = \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial p}\\\\\n\\dot{p} = - \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThis system of differential equations yields the functions \\(x(t)\\) and \\(p(t)\\). But to compute them is not our goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\nIs it me, or did I pull the frequency \\(\\omega\\) out of my a#$. Right? Here is some insight, imagine a stiff spring, then we expect a high frequency of oscillation, this is what the formula\n\\[ \\omega =\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}},  \\]\ntells us, the higher the \\(k\\) for a fixed mass \\(m\\), the higher the frequency \\(\\omega\\). The formula is derived from classical theory, if you don’t remember how, don’t worry since we will not need it anyway, just take it as a fact of life that makes intuitive sense."

    "text": "Properties of the atomic polynomials\nRather than showing a picture of a small slice of the function as de did in Figure 1 we can instead zoom into some aspects of it.\n\nProperties of the connectivity between domain and codomain:\n\nRange: From inspection of Equation 1 (or Equation 2) we know the domain and codomain of these four functions is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). The range of these functions is the image of the domain under the action of the function, we can infer what this image is by inspecting Figure 1, for example, the image of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) under the action of \\(e_2\\) is the set of all positive reals as we check by the red curve hence we write \\(e_2(\\mathbb{R})=\\mathbb{R}^+_0\\). Similarly we find:\n\n\\[\ne_0(\\mathbb{R})=\\{1\\} \\qquad e_1(\\mathbb{R})=e_3(\\mathbb{R})=\\mathbb{R}\\qquad e_2(\\mathbb{R})=\\mathbb{R}^+_0\n\\]\n\nOnto: We also observe that for even powers of \\(n\\) such as \\(e_0\\) and \\(e_2\\), not all elements in the codomain \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) are hit by outputs, i.e., these are not onto function; as an example, [is \\(0\\) hit by some \\(e_0(x)\\) ? Is \\(-1\\) hit by \\(e_2(x)\\), for some \\(x\\) in its domain?] We can answer these question by trying to solve the equations \\(e_0(x)=0\\) and \\(e_2(x)=-1\\). To no avail! Neither have solutions \\(x\\) in the domain \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n1-1: Additionally nor are these even powers 1-1. Why? Because we can clearly see from Figure 1 that \\(e_0\\) is in fact the worst possible “labeller”, where all “fruits” \\(x\\) have exactly the same label \\(1\\), no other “label” in its codomain \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is put into good use by this \\(e_0\\); the function \\(e_2\\) is not as bad since for each label we find just two elements in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). The functions \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_3\\) are 1-1 since each element \\(x\\) in their domain have a unique element \\(y\\) in the codomain, hence if we choose a label \\(y\\) we uniquely know the \\(x\\). Summarizing:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}e_0 \\qquad &\\text{worst possible labeler (one label for all inputs)}\\\\e_2 \\qquad  &\\text{bad labeller (one label for each pair of inputs)}\\\\e_1\\,\\, \\text{and}\\,\\, e_3 \\qquad &\\text{perfect (one label, one input)}\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\n\nProperties at interesting regions of the function:\n\nWho is bigger or smaller? The Figure 1 reveals something funny:\n\nfor points on the horizontal axis close to the origin, that is \\(-1&lt;x&lt;1\\), the outputs of the four functions have the following rank \\(x^3 &lt; x^2 &lt; x^1 &lt; x^0\\);\nprecisely at \\(x=1\\) we find they are all the same \\(x^0=x^1=x^2=x^3=1\\);\nmeanwhile for the remaining points, those in the region \\(x&lt;-1 \\lor 1&lt;x\\), the absolute value of these functions follow the reversed rank! \\(x^0&lt;x^1&lt;x^2&lt;x^3\\).\nFor \\(x\\) very far from \\(1\\) we find \\(x^0\\ll x^1\\ll x^2\\ll x^3\\), which means, for example, that \\(|x^3|\\) is much, much, much, much larger then \\(|x^2|\\), and so on.\n\nIn summary:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nx^3 &lt; x^2 &lt; x^1 &lt; x^0 \\qquad &\\text{for $x$ close to 1}\\\\x^0=x^1=x^2=x^3 \\qquad &\\text{for $x=1$}\\\\x^0\\ll x^1\\ll x^2\\ll x^3 \\qquad &\\text{for $x$ far from $1$}\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nThis summary will be important when we study the limiting behavior of molecular polynomials.\nZeros: The zeros of a function are the coordinates of the points which intercept the axes. Observing Figure 1 we see polynomial \\(1\\) intercepts the y-axis at \\((0,1)\\) while all other polynomials intercept the x-axis and y-axis exactly at the origin \\((0,0)\\).\nMaxima and minima: By inspection of Figure 1, we observe the polynomials \\(1\\) has no maxima or minima, it is always flat; \\(x\\) and \\(x^3\\) on the other hand is a ramp, a never ending one, and thus also does not have a maximum or minimum. The only function exhibiting a minimum is \\(x^2\\), coincidentally, at \\((0,0)\\). Only when we study derivatives we’ll have the computational means to find these extrema.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommentary\n\n\n\nThe previous list of properties was already embedded in Figure 1 (or if you think about it, already at Equation 2), only by close observation we made it explicit. Of course, the list is not exhaustive, many other properties remain hidden in that picture, waiting to be dug out. This is why I said this list are a zoom into the picture, when we get closer we see more detail.\nAs additional examples we could also ask how fast a polynomial of degree one increases, i.e., what is its slope; for polynomials of degree two it would make sense to ask if it its graph is a cup or a cap, it all depends on \\(a_2\\) parameter.\nWe usually do not list the properties just as we did above, we just acknowledge in our mind that they exist and compute them as needed, since many times some of them are so bluntly obvious just by looking at the graph or the function formula, that no need is required for a calculation."

If values of some of these parameters are given, these equations can be used to compute the other.\nAs example: You give \\(a_0\\) and \\(a_1\\) and I can compute \\(x_0\\) and \\(y_0\\). How? If you give me \\(a_0=3\\) and \\(a_1=2\\), I pick an arbitrary \\(x_0\\), for example \\(x_0=4\\) and compute\n\\[\ny_0=3+2\\times 4=11\n\\]\nIn conclusion we have two equations aesthetically different but exactly the same:\n\\[\ny=2x+3 \\iff y=2(x-4)+11\n\\tag{8}\\]\nThe right hand side aesthetic is much better because it allow us to see easily how fast these polynomials of degree one increase.\n\n\nHow fast does the function increase?\nThe constant \\(m\\) (the \\(2\\) in Equation 8) is called the slope of the line, what does it mean the value of the slope? The meaning of this constant - in fact any constant in mathematics - can be deduced by analyzing the equation in which it appears. In this case, we understand \\(m\\) by understanding \\(y=m(x-x_0)+y_0\\), rearranging it we find:\n\\[\nm=\\frac{y-y_0}{x-x_0}\n\\tag{9}\\]\nwhich tells us that \\(m\\) is a ratio of two distances, the height of the triangle \\(y-y_0\\) and the length of the base of the triangle \\(x-x_0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A line and two point.\n\n\n\nSince \\(m\\) is the ratio of these two distances, its sign determines weather the function is increasing or not. Observing Figure 1 we see \\(x-x_0&gt;0\\) and \\(y-y_0&gt;0\\) therefore for this particular choice of two points we find \\(m&gt;0\\), the same conclusion would hold for any other. When \\(m\\) is positive, then the \\(y\\)’s in \\((x,y)\\) increase when the \\(x\\)’s increase as well.\nBy the same line of reasoning the \\(m&lt;0\\) would correspond to decreasing function, one where as \\(x\\) increases then the \\(y\\)’s decrease. And by the way, \\(m=0\\) correspond to horizontal lines but these are polynomials of degree zero and not of degree one. The larger \\(m\\) becomes the closer the line is to a vertical line, but it never truly becomes a vertical line.\nWe can actually arrive at these conclusions just looking at \\(y=m(x-x_0)+y_0\\), no rearranging required: when \\(m\\) is positive, then the greater \\(x-x_0\\) is, the more we add to the default value \\(y_0\\), thus the \\(y\\) must increase; if on the other hand \\(m\\) is negative, the term \\(m(x-x_0)\\) can only become more negative as \\(x-x_0\\) increases, thus lowering the value of \\(m(x-x_0)+y_0\\), that is, the value of \\(y\\), the function must be decreasing when \\(x-x_0\\) increases.\n\n\nZeros\nWhat are the zeros in \\(P_1\\)? Look at Figure 2, there are (in this case) two types of zeros: \\(x\\)-zeros and \\(y\\)-zeros. The \\(x\\)-zeros occur when the \\(x\\) coordinate is zero and the \\(y\\)-zeros when \\(y\\) is zero. In other words, the zeros of a polynomials of degree one are the ordered pairs (in \\(P_1\\)) that satisfy either one of these equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\\begin{cases}y=y_0+m(x-x_0)\\\\y=0\\end{cases}\\qquad\\qquad\\begin{cases}y=y_0+m(x-x_0)\\\\x=0\\end{cases}\\end{equation}\n\\]\nSolving the first systems of equations we get \\(x=(0-y_0)/m+x_0\\) and solving the second \\(y=y_0+m(0-x_0)\\). Hence we know zeros of \\(P_1\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\textit{x-zero:} \\qquad (0,y_0-mx_0)\\\\\n&\\textit{y-zero:} \\qquad (x_0-y_0/m,0)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nWhen \\(x\\) is large, then what?\nWe can get to know qualitatively what happens with points coordinates of \\(P_1\\) at its extreme ends of the set by supposing \\(x\\) is a very, very large number; there is however an important key point: we are not particularly worried about a specific large value of \\(x\\), like \\(x=10^{100}\\) , and its corresponding \\(y\\); what we really want to know is - as \\(x\\) is getting larger and larger, how does \\(y\\) behave then? It is a dynamical process, not a specific evaluation of the function.\n\nParaphrased differently, we want to know what happens to \\((x,y)\\) during the process of making \\(x\\) bigger and bigger? To state that \\(x\\) is getting bigger and bigger, we write \\(x\\longrightarrow \\infty\\). In such a dynamic case, what happens with the value \\(y\\)? Meaning, what is the dynamic solution \\(y\\) of the system:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\\begin{cases}y=y_0+m(x-x_0)\\\\x\\longrightarrow +\\infty\\end{cases}\\end{equation}\n\\tag{10}\\]\nLets make an intuitive guess about the solution of this problem (later, when we study limits we’ll see a more systematic way to solve these problems), the Figure 3 helps a lot. To understand how the values of \\(y\\) behave when \\(x\\) increases, we have to understand how the calculation \\(y_0+m(x-x_0)\\) behaves, when we keep increasing \\(x\\). A key aspect of it, is that the term \\(m x\\) gets larger and larger while \\(y_0-mx_0\\) remains a constant, eventually, \\(mx\\) is so much larger than this constant (we are increasing \\(x\\) after all) that our original equation \\(y=y_0+m(x-x_0)\\) becomes approximately given by \\(y\\sim mx\\). The functions \\(y_0+m(x-x_0)\\) and \\(mx\\) are different! But when \\(x\\) is large they are very similar because the constant \\(y_0-mx_0\\) becomes irrelevant. Now we shift our focus to the approximate equation and try to solve it:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\\begin{cases}y\\sim mx\\\\x\\longrightarrow +\\infty\\end{cases}\\end{equation}\n\\tag{11}\\]\nThis is easy, because its just an atomic polynomial. The dynamical solution to this problem is [ \\(y\\) will increase when \\(x\\) increases], we write the answer as \\(y\\longrightarrow +\\infty\\) when \\(m\\) is positive. As a consequence the answer to Equation 10 is also \\(y\\longrightarrow +\\infty\\).\nObserve that the function \\(y\\sim mx\\) is not equal to \\(y=y_0+m(x-x_0)\\), and thus their graphs are not equal, but when \\(x\\) is very large, they are similar, see picture below. Solving Equation 11 we automatically get the answer to the problem Equation 10 . Both answers are \\(y\\longrightarrow+\\infty\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Does y grow when x grows?\n\n\n\nIf on the other hand \\(m\\) is negative then, by the same reasoning, \\(y\\) also becomes very negative.\nAwful Exercise: What happens to \\(y\\) when \\(x\\longrightarrow-\\infty\\)?"

    "text": "Relating the two basis\nWe want to express the kets \\(\\ket{S,M}\\) of the new basis in terms of \\(\\ket{m_1,m_2}\\) that constitute the old basis, to do that we argue pictorially:\n\nOn the left side of the picture we see a graphical organization of the old basis and on the right side the new basis. We identify in each basis, the elements that span the subspaces \\(\\mathcal{E}(M)\\) for each \\(M\\); this is easily done on the right picture because the horizontal axis already tells us the \\(M\\)’s, on the left picture we need to recall that each basis ket is an eigenvector of \\(S_z\\) with eigenvalue \\(M\\hbar=(m_1+m_2)\\hbar\\). Careful inspection of these subspaces shows us that: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\ket{S=1,M=1}\\in \\mathcal{E}(M=1)\\\\\n&\\ket{m_1=1/2,m_2=1/2}\\in \\mathcal{E}(M=1)\n\\end{align}\n\\] and since the subspace is one-dimensional, these two basis kets must coincide. We write: \\[\n\\ket{1,1}=\\ket{1/2,1/2}\n\\] We just succeeded in establishing the first connection of both basis, more, the remaining connections follow from this one, as falling dominos. Using the lower operator defined as \\(S_-:=S_{1-}+S_{2-}\\) we find \\(\\ket{1,0}\\):\n\n\\[\nS_-\\ket{1,1}=(S_{1-}+S_{2-})\\ket{1/2,1/2}\n\\]\nThe left hand side gives us: \\[\n\\hbar\\sqrt{1(1+1)-0(0-1)}\\ket{1,0}\n\\] The right hand side is: \\[\n\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+1\\right)-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-1\\right)}\\left(\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}+\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)\n\\] Thus: \\[\n\\hbar\\sqrt{2}\\ket{1,0}=\\hbar\\left(\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}+\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)\n\\] Which yields: \\[\n\\ket{1,0}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}+\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)\n\\] In \\(\\mathcal{E}(M=1)\\) there is still \\(\\ket{0,0}\\), we use its properties to derive the connection:\n\nWe know it is a linear combination of \\(\\ket{-1/2,1/2}\\) and \\(\\ket{1/2,-1/2}\\) thus we write: \\[\n\\ket{0,0}=c_1\\ket{-1/2,1/2}+c_2\\ket{1/2,-1/2}\n\\] for some complex numbers \\(c_{1,2}\\).\nWe know it is orthogonal to \\(\\ket{1,0}\\), thus we write: \\[\n0=\\braket{1,0|0,0}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(c_1+c_2)\n\\]\nWe also know it is normalized, i.e., \\[\n1=\\braket{0,0|0,0}=|c_1|^2+|c_2|^2\n\\]\n\nSolving these equations we conclude one possible solution is: \\[\nc_1=-c_2=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\] Hence, the second basis vector in \\(\\mathcal{E}(M=0)\\) is: \\[\n\\ket{0,0}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}-\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)\n\\] Finally, to get the last connection between the new and old basis, we act with either \\(S_-\\) on \\(\\ket{1,0}\\):\n\nOr we simply notice that \\(\\mathcal{E}(M=-1)\\) is also one dimensional and therefore: \\[\n\\ket{1,-1}=\\ket{-1/2,-1/2}\n\\]"

    "text": "In QM there are essentially two types of angular momentum: Orbital Angular Momentum and Spin Angular momentum.\n\nOrbital angular momentum is defined as an analog of the classical one, as\n\\[\n\\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{R}\\times \\mathbf{P}\n\\tag{1}\\] \\(\\mathbf{R}=(X,Y,Z)\\) and \\(\\mathbf{P}=(P_x,P_y,P_z)\\) are vectors whose entries are operators.\nThis formula is a compact way of writing:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nL_x = YP_z-ZP_y\\\\\nL_y = Z P_x -XP_z\\\\\nL_z = XP_y-YP_x\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nFrom the three components of \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) and the canonical commutation relations:\n\\[\n[X,P_x]=i\\hbar \\qquad [Y,P_y]=i\\hbar \\qquad [Z,P_z]=i\\hbar\n\\]\nwe can derive the following ones:\n\\[\n[L_x,L_y]=i\\hbar L_z\\qquad [L_y,L_z]=i\\hbar L_x\\qquad [L_z,L_x]=i\\hbar L_y\\qquad [L_i,L_j]=0\\quad \\text{for}\\ i\\not= j\n\\tag{3}\\]\nFrom one perspective, these are the commutation relations for the components of the quantum angular momentum that stem from Equation 1 and Equation 3. From a different perspective we can say that the angular momentum Equation 1 is a particular example of \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) that satisfy these three commutation “equations” in Equation 3. In other words, \\(\\mathbf{R}\\times \\mathbf{P}\\) is a solution of Equation 3.\nIn QM one wants to talk about more general angular momentum, for example spin angular momentum, it has no classical analog and hence is not defined explicitly as \\(\\mathbf{R}\\times \\mathbf{P}\\). However one can still define it implicitly, by saying that whatever spin angular momentum operator is, it must satisfy the previous commutations relation.\n\nThese two observations motivates us to introduce a generic angular momentum, with letter \\(\\mathbf{J}\\), for which the only thing we know is that it obeys the rules:\n\\[\n[J_x,J_y]=i\\hbar J_z\\qquad [J_y,J_z]=i\\hbar J_x\\qquad [J_z,J_x]=i\\hbar J_y\\qquad [J_i,J_j]=0\\quad \\text{for}\\ i\\not= j\n\\tag{4}\\]\n\\(\\mathbf{J}\\) can be either the orbital angular momentum of a particle or the spin angular momentum or a combination of these, since all quantum angular momenta has commutation relations of form Equation 4 .\n\n\n\nGiven \\(\\mathbf{J}\\) we can introduce now its norm squared \\(J^2\\), defined as:\n\\[\nJ^2=J_x^2+J_y^2+J_z^2\n\\tag{5}\\]\nWe can easily show (we’ll skip the boring details) from Equation 4 that Equation 5 commutes with the three components of \\(\\mathbf{J}\\), that is:\n\\[\n[J^2,J_x]=0\\qquad[J^2,J_y]=0\\qquad[J^2,J_z]=0\n\\tag{6}\\]\nFor example, using Equation 4 we find:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n[J^2,J_z]&=[J_x^2+J_y^2+J_z^2,J_z]\\\\\n&=[J_x^2,J_z]+[J_y^2,J_z]+[J_z^2,J_z]\\\\\n&=0+0+0\\\\\n&=0\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThat fact that \\(J^2\\) commutes with \\(J_z\\) will be of great importance, because it guarantees one can find (and thus define) a set of basis kets in the Hilbert space that are simultaneously eigenstates of both, \\(J^2\\) and \\(J_z\\). Moreover, since the commuting operators are hermitian (we say in QM they are observables) the eigenstates of the operators can be made orthogonal and the eigenvalues are real.\n\n\n\nOur goal is to define (to be mare specific, to define is to give meaningful names to something) a basis of eigenstates common to \\(J^2\\) and \\(J_z\\) for our Hilbert Space. Why? One of the most important goals in QM is to find the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian of the system, paraphrased differently, we say, we want to find the basis of eigenstates of \\(H\\). Imagine we have an Hamiltonian which commutes with \\(J^2\\) and \\(J_z\\), then we know we can find a basis of eigenstates common to the three operators. Knowing already what is the eigenbasis common to \\(\\{J^2,J_z\\}\\) greatly facilitates finding the eigenstates of \\(H\\). The three operators (observables) constitute a complete set of commuting observables (CSCO) \\[ \\{H,J^2,J_z\\} \\] and we want to define its eigenbasis.\n\n\n\nIn summary, skipping the proofs, what the commutation relations introduced in Equation 4 allow us to conclude is:\n\nThe eigenvalues of \\(J^2\\) are of the form \\(j(j+1)\\hbar^2\\) and those of \\(J_z\\) are \\(m\\hbar\\) where \\(j\\) is a positive integer or semi-integer and \\(-j\\leq m\\leq j\\) in steps of \\(1\\).\nThe corresponding eigenvectors can be labelled by the numbers \\(j\\) and \\(m\\).\n\nIn other words:\n\\[ \\begin{align}&J^2\\ket{j,m}=j(j+1)\\hbar^2\\ket{j,m},\\\\&J_z\\ket{j,m}=m\\hbar\\ket{j,m}.\\end{align}  \\tag{7}\\]\nThe only values that \\(j\\) can take are \\(0\\), \\(1/2\\), \\(3/2\\), \\(2\\), etc. For example, if \\(j=3/2\\) then \\(m=-3/2,-1/2,1/2,3/2\\).\n\n\n\nBy definition we have: \\[ J_+=J_x+iJ_y\\qquad J_-=J_x-iJ_y\\qquad.  \\tag{8}\\] There are now plenty commutations relations we can derive that relate these two operators and either \\(J^2\\) or \\(J\\), but the ultimate consequence of these relations is that they tell us how to organize the eigenbasis of \\(\\{J^2,J_z\\}\\), we’ll see that in 6).\nAdditionally, these definitions allow us to write:\n\\[ J_x = \\frac{1}{2}(J_++J_-) \\qquad J_y = \\frac{1}{2i}(J_+-J_-), \\]\nwhich will be useful later.\nHow do Equation 8 operators act on the eigenstates of \\(\\{J^2,J_z\\}\\)?\nAnswer:\n\\[ J_\\pm \\ket{n,j,m}=\\hbar \\sqrt{j(j+1)-m(m\\pm 1)}\\ket{n,j,m\\pm 1},  \\tag{9}\\]\nA formula which is, no surprise, derived from Equation 4 (through a rather complicated path). The names raising and lowering comes form the fact that \\(m\\) is either raised by \\(+1\\) or lowered by \\(-1\\) each time \\(J_\\pm\\) acts.\n\n\n\nFrom Equation 7 and Equation 9 emerges the following picture\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Eigenspaces for various values of j.\n\n\n\nwhich organizes the eigenstates for values of \\(j\\) from \\(0\\) up to \\(2\\), each blue dot in the picture corresponds to basis vector \\(\\ket{j,m}\\). These kets constitute an orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space, and in the picture we also see as horizontal boxes the subspaces \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1/2)\\) up to \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=2)\\) spanned by the basis kets (blue dots).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommentary\n\n\n\n\nFrom the first equation in Equation 7 we notice that for a given value of \\(j\\), for example \\(j=1\\), then \\(\\{|1,1\\rangle,|1,0\\rangle,|1,-1\\rangle\\}\\) are eigenvectors of \\(J^2\\) with the same eigenvalue \\(1(1+1)\\hbar^2\\) , we therefore say the eigenvalue is 3-degenerate, or that the space \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1)\\) spanned by this basis is 3-degenerate. We distinguish the 3 eigenvectors by the \\(J_z\\) eigenvalue \\(m\\hbar\\), or more simply by just the integer \\(m\\).\nSubspaces of the Hilbert space can now be specified by fixing \\(j\\) for example, or by fixing \\(m\\) for various values. The eigenbasis within each \\(\\mathcal{E}(j)\\) is connected by the raising and lowering operators as we see by the red and green arrows in the figure above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo obtain the matrix representation of an operator on a given vector space we need to know how this operator acts on that space; we know how it acts on a given vector space by knowing how it acts on the chosen basis. Note: The matrix representation of the operator is then specific for the basis.\nFor example, let us choose the space \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1)\\) of eigenvectors of \\(\\{J^2,J_z\\}\\), the basis is:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{B}=\\{|1,1\\rangle,|1,0\\rangle,|1,-1\\rangle\\}\n\\tag{10}\\]\nsee Figure 1 .\nTo know how \\(J_x\\) acts in \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1)\\) we compute how it acts on the basis Equation 10:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nJ_x|1,1\\rangle &= \\frac{1}{2}(J_+ +J_-)|1,1\\rangle\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}J_+|1,1\\rangle+\\frac{1}{2}J_-|1,1\\rangle\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sqrt{1(1+1)-1(1+1)}|1,2\\rangle+\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sqrt{1(1+1)-1(1-1)}|1,0\\rangle\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}|1,0\\rangle\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{11}\\]\nWe conclude that when \\(J_x\\) acts on the basis element \\(|1,1\\rangle\\) it outputs \\(|1,0\\rangle\\) times a constant, notice the input and output both live in \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1)\\).\nLet us see now what happens when \\(J_x\\) acts on the second basis ket \\(|1,0\\rangle\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nJ_x|1,0\\rangle &= \\frac{1}{2}(J_++J_-)|1,0\\rangle\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sqrt{1(1+1)-0(0+1)}|1,1\\rangle+\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sqrt{1(1+1)-0(0-1)}|1,1\\rangle|1,-1\\rangle\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}(|1,1\\rangle+|1,-1\\rangle)\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{12}\\]\nAs \\(J_x\\) acts on \\(|1,0\\rangle\\) it gives a linear combination \\(|1,1\\rangle+|1,-1\\rangle\\) of basis vectors, which in turn also lives in \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1)\\).\nAnd finally, a similar calculation would shows the action on the third ket is:\n\\[\nJ_x|1,-1\\rangle =\\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}|1,0\\rangle\n\\tag{13}\\]\nAgain, the input \\(|1,-1\\rangle\\) is in \\(\\mathcal {E}(j=1)\\) and so is the output \\(|1,0\\rangle\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommentary\n\n\n\nThe calculation above shows clearly that the the operator \\(J_x\\) maps the basis of \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1)\\) into vectors in \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1)\\). Therefore, in general it will map any ket of \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1)\\) into another in \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1)\\); the jargon for this observation is to say that “\\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1)\\) is globally invariant under the action of \\(J_x\\)”; more colloquially we just say “the action of \\(J_x\\) is stuck in the subspace”. This observation is a consequence of the fact that the operator in question \\(J_x\\) commutes with the operator \\(J^2\\) that characterizes the subspace\n\\[\n[J^2,J_x]=0 \\implies [\\text{the action of $J_x$ is stuck in the subspaces of $J^2$}]\n\\]\n\n\nNow lets get the matrix representation of \\(J_x\\) in \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1)\\). The results in Equation 11, Equation 12 and Equation 13 are summarizes in step 0:\n\nStep zero:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nJ_x|1,1\\rangle=\\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}|1,0\\rangle\\\\\nJ_x|1,0\\rangle =\\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}(|1,1\\rangle+|1,-1\\rangle)\\\\\nJ_x|1,-1\\rangle =\\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}|1,0\\rangle\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{14}\\] note, these formulas are important: they tell us how \\(J_x\\) acts on the chosen basis of chosen subspace \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1)\\). From then we can now write the corresponding matrix representation, but:\nFirst step: write the identity of \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1)\\):\n\\[\n1 = \\sum_{m=-1,0,1} |1,m\\rangle\\langle1,m|\n\\]\nSecond step: write \\(J_x\\) between the identities:\n\n\\[\nJ_x = \\sum_{m,m'=1,0,-1}|1,m\\rangle\\langle1,m|J_x|1,m'\\rangle\\langle1,m'|\n\\tag{15}\\]\n\nThird step: substitute Equation 14 in Equation 15:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nJ_x &= \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(|1,0\\rangle\\langle 1,1|+|1,1\\rangle\\langle 1,0|+|1,-1\\rangle\\langle 1,0|+|1,0\\rangle\\langle 1,-1|\\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{16}\\]\nFourth, write Equation 16 using using matrix notation. If we agree to order the basis as \\(\\{|1,1\\rangle, |1,0\\rangle,|1,-1\\rangle\\}\\) we find:\n\n\nWe can name this matrix as \\([J_x]_\\mathcal{B}\\), thenotation remind us: this is a matrix representing the action of \\(J_x\\) in the \\(\\mathcal{B}\\)! The squiggly arrow just mean: “it is represented by”.\nRepeating these steps for \\(J_y\\) and \\(J_z\\) yields the results:\n\nThe matrix \\([J_z]_\\mathcal{B}\\) is diagonal since the basis elements we choose for \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1)\\) are its eigenvectors, the diagonal elements are the the three \\(m\\hbar\\) eigenvalues \\(m=1,0,-1\\). Since they are also eigenvectors of \\(J^2\\) we find a diagonal with the \\(1(1+1)\\hbar^2=2\\hbar^2\\) eigenvalues repeated three times:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommentary\n\n\n\nThe equal sign in Equation 15 and Equation 16 is not accurate, because the right hand side is the representation only on the subspace \\(\\mathcal{E}(l=1)\\), while the left hand side is the “whole operator”. What would be accurate is to use the entire basis and write:\n\\[\nJ_x =\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty\\sum_{-l\\leq m,m'\\leq l}|l,m\\rangle\\langle l,m|J_x|l,m'\\rangle\\langle l,m'|\n\\]\nrather than Equation 15.\nWe could emphasize the distinction by defining a new operator \\(J'_x\\) which is restricted to act only in this subspace:\n\\[\nJ'_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(|1,0\\rangle\\langle 1,1|+|1,1\\rangle\\langle 1,0|+|1,-1\\rangle\\langle 1,0|+|1,0\\rangle\\langle 1,-1|\\right)\n\\tag{17}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe intrinsic spin angular momentum of an electron is described by states living in the \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1/2)\\) subspace (see Figure 1), the basis for this subspace is (as usual) furnished by the simultaneous eigenvectors of the \\(J^2\\) and \\(J_z\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}&J^2\\ket{1/2,m}=\\frac{3}{4}\\hbar^2\\ket{1/2,m}\\\\&J_z\\ket{1/2,m}=m\\hbar\\ket{1/2,m}\\end{align}\n\\tag{18}\\]\nwhere \\(m=\\pm 1/2\\). Therefore we say\n\\[\n\\mathcal{E}(j=1/2)=\\text{span}\n\\{|1/2,1/2\\rangle,|1/2,-1/2\\rangle\\}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotation\n\n\n\n\ngiven \\(j=1/2\\) is fixed, it is usual to drop it from the ket notation and simply write \\(|m\\rangle\\) where \\(m=\\pm1/2\\).\nwe can rename \\(m\\) as \\(m_s\\) and then reexpress it as \\(m_s=\\sigma/2\\) with \\(\\sigma =\\pm\\) or \\(\\sigma=\\uparrow,\\downarrow\\), but for the present notes we’ll keep the \\(m_s\\) notation.\nThe \\(j=1/2\\) states are very important (they are the states that describe electrons spins for example), so much that we rename the operators \\(\\{J^2,J_z\\}\\) into \\(\\{S^2,S_z\\}\\) . Instead of Equation 18 we should write:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}&S^2\\ket{m_s}=\\frac{3}{4}\\hbar^2\\ket{m_s}\\\\&S_z\\ket{m_s}=m_s\\hbar\\ket{m_s}\\end{align}\n\\]\nto emphasize the act, these operators only act on \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1/2)\\). Recall we already did something similar when we defined \\(J'_x\\) in Equation 17.\n\n\n\nThe basis states \\(\\{|1/2\\rangle,|-1/2\\rangle\\}\\) that span the subspace \\(\\mathcal{E}(1/2)\\) are connect by the raising \\(S_+\\) and lowering operator \\(S_-\\) introduced in Equation 9:\n\\[\nS_+\\ket{-1/2}=\\hbar\\sqrt{1/2(1/2+1)-1/2(1/2+1)}\\ket{1/2}=\\hbar\\sqrt{2}/2\\ket{1/2}\n\\tag{19}\\]\nThe raising and lowering operators are important for another reason, they tell us how \\(S_x\\) and \\(S_y\\) act on the eigenbasis of \\(\\{S^2,S_z\\}\\), from their definition we have:\n\\[\nS_x=\\frac{1}{2}(J_++J_-) \\qquad S_y=\\frac{1}{2i}(J_+-J_-)\n\\tag{20}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommentary\n\n\n\nIn order to know how \\(S_x\\) and \\(S_y\\) act on this basis requires first to reexpress these operators in terms of operator we know how they act in this basis, the formulas Equation 20 together with Equation 19 do precisely that.\n\n\nBy knowing how an operator acts on a basis we know how obtain its matrix representation, for example, let us take a look at \\(S_z\\) and then \\(S_x\\) and \\(S_y\\). We can write the action of \\(S_z\\) on the basis \\(\\{\\ket{1/2},\\ket{-1/2}\\}\\) as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}&S_z\\ket{1/2}=\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\ket{1/2}+0\\ket{-1/2}\\\\&S_z\\ket{-1/2}=0\\ket{1/2}+\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\ket{-1/2}\\end{align}\n\\]\nthis is step zero of the steps found in 7). Following them again, we compute the numbers \\(\\braket{m|S_z|m'}\\), which we organize into the matrix:\n\\[\n[S_z]_{\\mathcal{E}(j=1/2)}=\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\\\0 & -1\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nTo get the matrices for \\(S_x\\) and \\(S_y\\) in the basis \\(\\{\\ket{-1/2},\\ket{1/2}\\}\\), act with them on the basis. Following the steps zero thought step four, the numbers \\(\\braket{m|S_x|m'}\\) and \\(\\braket{m|S_y|m'}\\) can be arranged into the matrices:\n\\[\n[S_x]_{\\mathcal{E}(j=1/2)}=\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\\\1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}\\qquad[S_y]_{\\mathcal{E}(j=1/2)}=\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\begin{pmatrix}0 & -i\\\\i & 0\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\n\nThis section uses the example of the helium atom to explain why we focus in the next sections just on the spin part of the states of two electrons. See the Conclusion at the end.\nThe basis states of a system of two electrons such as the helium atom (2 electrons orbiting a nucleus) are of the form:\n\\[\n|n, l, m, m_s; n', l', m', m_s'\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1-P_{21})(|1:n, l, m, m_s; 2: n', l',m',m_s'\\rangle)\n\\tag{21}\\]\nwhere \\(P_{21}\\) permutes the \\(1\\), \\(2\\) indices. The \\(n\\) is the principal quantum number, \\(l\\) together with \\(m\\) describes the orbit angular momentum of the first electron, finally \\(m_s\\) together with the suppressed \\(s=1/2\\) determines its spin angular momentum. The primed indices describe the second electron.\nSince both electron have semi-integer spin \\(s=s'=1/2\\) the quantum states \\(|n, l, m, m_s; n', l', m', m_s'\\rangle\\) must be antisymmetric for the exchange of particles.\nThe operator \\(1-P_{21}\\) acting on the tensor product ket \\(|1:n, l, m, m_s; 2: n', l',m',m_s'\\rangle\\) makes Equation 21 antisymmetric.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall\n\n\n\nBy definition \\(|1:\\phi;2:\\psi\\rangle := |1:\\phi\\rangle \\otimes |2:\\psi\\rangle\\). (example: \\(\\phi=n,l,m,m_s\\) and \\(\\psi=n',l',m',m_s'\\))\nThe state \\((1+P_{21})|1:\\phi;2:\\psi\\rangle\\) is equal to \\(|1:\\phi;2:\\psi\\rangle + |1:\\psi;2:\\phi\\rangle\\), which is symmetric because exchange of \\(1\\rightarrow 2\\) leaves the ket unchanged:\n\\[\nP_{21} (|1:\\phi;2:\\psi\\rangle + |1:\\psi;2:\\phi\\rangle) = |1:\\phi;2:\\psi\\rangle + |1:\\psi;2:\\phi\\rangle\n\\]\nOn the other hand \\((1-P_{21})|1:\\phi;2:\\psi\\rangle\\) is equal to \\(|1:\\phi;2:\\psi\\rangle - |1:\\psi;2:\\phi\\rangle\\) which is antissymetric because a minus sign emerges from the permutation of indices:\n\\[\nP_{21} (|1:\\phi;2:\\psi\\rangle - |1:\\psi;2:\\phi\\rangle) = -(|1:\\phi;2:\\psi\\rangle - |1:\\psi;2:\\phi\\rangle)\n\\]\nIf the two particles where in the same state \\(\\phi=\\psi\\) then:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&(1+P_{21})|1:\\phi;2:\\phi\\rangle = 2 |1:\\phi;2:\\phi\\rangle\\\\\n&(1-P_{21})|1:\\phi;2:\\phi\\rangle = 0\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nHence, the operator \\(1-P_{21}\\) prevents the two states to be equal, by reducing them to zero.\nThe operator \\(1\\pm P_{21}\\) is the mathematical agent that ensures the Pauli Exclusion Principle is obeyed. The \\(+\\) is applyed for boson i.e. for integer \\(j\\) particles; the \\(-\\) is applied for fermions, i.e., for particles with semi-integer \\(j\\).\n\n\nSince the spins are semi-integers \\(s=s'=1/2\\), by Pauli Exclusion Principle states that: two electrons in the same quantum, i.e., the primed and unprimed indices are equal \\(n=n'\\), \\(l=l'\\), \\(m=m'\\) and \\(m_s=m_s'\\), these states are not physical, meaning their wave function is \\(0\\). By writing Equation 21 where we find the operator \\(1-P_{21}\\), we render this ket to \\(0\\) if those indices are equal; and non-zero otherwise.\nA non-zero state is for example the case \\(n=n'=1\\), \\(l=l'=m=m'=0\\) and \\(m_s=\\uparrow\\) and \\(m_s'=\\downarrow\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n|1,0,0,\\uparrow;1,0,0,\\downarrow\\rangle &=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1-P_{21})(|1:1, 0, 0, \\uparrow; 2: 1, 0,0,\\downarrow\\rangle)\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|1:1, 0, 0, \\uparrow; 2: 1, 0,0,\\downarrow\\rangle-|1:1, 0, 0, \\downarrow; 2: 1, 0,0,\\uparrow\\rangle)\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\underbrace{|1:1, 0, 0; 2: 1,0,0\\rangle}_\\text{spacial part}\\otimes(\\underbrace{|1:\\uparrow;2:\\downarrow\\rangle-|1:\\downarrow;2:\\uparrow\\rangle}_\\text{spin part})\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{22}\\]\nObserving the right hand side of Equation 22 we notice it has two parts:\n\nthe spacial part is symmetric for the exchange of indices, just apply \\(P_{21}\\) and we get a plus sign on the right hand side:\n\n\\[\nP_{21}|1:1, 0, 0; 2: 1,0,0\\rangle = |1:1, 0, 0; 2: 1,0,0\\rangle\n\\]\n\nthe spin part is antisymmetric, notice the minus sign:\n\n\\[\nP_{21} (|1:\\uparrow;2:\\downarrow\\rangle-|1:\\downarrow;2:\\uparrow\\rangle) = - (|1:\\uparrow;2:\\downarrow\\rangle-|1:\\downarrow;2:\\uparrow\\rangle)\n\\]\nAs a result the whole state Equation 22 acquires a minus sign when we switch \\(1\\) with \\(2\\) and it is considered antisymmetric:\n\\[\nP_{21} |1,0,0,1/2;1,0,0,-1/2\\rangle = - |1,0,0,1/2;1,0,0,-1/2\\rangle\n\\]\nConclusion: This simple example of the helium atom showed that the basis of the helium electrons are antissymetric kets of the form \\(\\text{space}\\otimes\\text{spin}\\). This example also showed us how PEP for fermions is incorporated mathematically into the ket states through \\(1-P_{12}\\), which makes the whole ket antissymetric. The whole ket includes the spacial and spin parts.\nI emphasize that neither the spacial or spin part have to necessarily be antissymetric, what is needed is that the whole state be antissymetric, and it must be so, because we are dealing with two semi-integer spin particles and PEP says so.\nFinally, since the basis of the helium atom we can split the spatial and spin parts, we will now devote the next sections focusing just on the spin part.\n\n\n\nThe basis states of the electron one is furnished by \\(\\{S_1^2,S_{1z}\\}\\) and for the electron two by \\(\\{S_2^2,S_{2z}\\}\\) in the usual manner:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}&S_1^2\\ket{m_1}=\\frac{3}{4}\\hbar^2\\ket{m_1}\\\\&S_{1z}\\ket{m_1}=m_1\\hbar\\ket{m_1}\\\\&S_2^2\\ket{m_2}=\\frac{3}{4}\\hbar^2\\ket{m_2}\\\\&S_{2z}\\ket{m_2}=m_2\\hbar\\ket{m_2}\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe spins magnitude of the two electrons is described by the quantum numbers\n\\[\ns_1=\\frac{1}{2}\\qquad s_2=\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\nThe basis states of two electrons is formed from the tensor product \\(\\ket{1:m_1}\\otimes \\ket{2:m_2}\\), there are four basis elements:\n\\[\n\\{\\ket{1:\\uparrow}\\otimes \\ket{2:\\uparrow},\\ket{1:\\uparrow}\\otimes \\ket{2:\\downarrow},\\ket{1:\\downarrow}\\otimes \\ket{2:\\uparrow},\\ket{1:\\downarrow}\\otimes \\ket{2:\\downarrow}\\}\n\\tag{23}\\]\nIt is important to understand that:\n\nThe observables \\(S^2_1\\) ,\\(S_{1z}\\) act on the space spanned by \\(\\{\\ket{1:-1/2},\\ket{1:1/2}\\}\\) while the observables \\(S^2_2\\), \\(S_{2z}\\) act on \\(\\{\\ket{2:-1/2},\\ket{2:1/2}\\}\\) and do not act on tensor product states.\nWe define however the extensions of \\(S^2_1\\), \\(S_{1z}\\), which act on the tensor product space as\n\n\\[\n\\tilde{S}_1^2=S_1^2\\otimes 1_2\\qquad \\tilde{S}_{1z}=S_{1z}\\otimes 1_2\n\\]\nThe extensions of \\(S^2_2\\) ,\\(S_{2z}\\) are defined analogously:\n\\[\n\\tilde{S}_2^2=1_1 \\otimes S_2^2\\qquad \\tilde{S}_{2z}=1_1\\otimes S_{2z}\n\\]\nTherefore we have for example:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\\tilde{S}_1^2(\\ket{m_1}\\otimes \\ket{m_2}) &= (S_1^2\\ket{m_1})\\otimes \\ket{m_2}\\\\&=(\\frac{3\\hbar}{4}\\ket{m_1})\\otimes \\ket{m_2}\\\\&=\\frac{3\\hbar}{4}\\ket{m_1}\\otimes \\ket{m_2}\\end{align}\n\\tag{24}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotation\n\n\n\nNote how in the ket Equation 24 we suppressed the \\(j_1=j_2=1/2\\) , the \\(1:\\) and \\(2:\\) and start using \\(m\\) in place of the old \\(m_s\\). Moreover we should go one step further and define\n\\[\n|m_1,m_2\\rangle :=|1:m_1\\rangle \\otimes |2:m_2\\rangle\n\\]\nAnd by the way, drop the ~ in \\(\\tilde{S}_{1,2}^2\\) and \\(\\tilde{S}_{z1,2}\\).\nThis simplified notation comes at the price of leaving to the reader the work of understanding its meaning from the context.\n\n\nAlso, the set of operators\n\\[\n\\{\\tilde{S}_1^2,\\tilde{S}_{1z},\\tilde{S}_2^2,\\tilde{S}_{2z}\\}\n\\tag{25}\\]\ncommute and as a result we know it exists a basis of common eigenstates exists, name this basis as Equation 23. It follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}&\\tilde{S}_1^2\\ket{m_1,m_2}=\\tilde{S}_2^2\\ket{m_1,m_2}=\\frac{3}{4}\\hbar\\ket{m_1,m_2}\\\\&\\tilde{S}_{1z}\\ket{m_1,m_2}=m_1 \\hbar\\ket{m_1,m_2}\\\\&\\tilde{S}_{2z}\\ket{m_1,m_2}=m_2 \\hbar\\ket{m_1,m_2}\\\\\\end{align}\n\\tag{26}\\]\nIn conclusion, the spin properties of a system with two particles (electrons) whose spin state is described by kets in \\(\\mathcal{E}_1(j_1=1/2)\\) and \\(\\mathcal{E}_2(j_2=1/2)\\) is described by a state of the form\n\\[\n\\ket{m_1,m_2}:=\\ket{m_1}\\otimes\\ket{m_2}\\qquad m_{1,2}=\\pm1/2\n\\tag{27}\\]\nwhich constitute a basis for the tensor product state space\n\\[\n\\mathcal{E}_{12}=\\mathcal{E}_1\\otimes\\mathcal{E}_2\n\\]\nA pictorial organization of our basis states if given as follows:\n\n\n\nThe blue dots represent a basis ket, the pink boxes we’ll be explained in next section.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe old basis Equation 27 help to define the states space \\(\\mathcal{E}_{12}(j_1=1/2,j_2=1/2)\\) , we want now to introduce a new basis, in particular we want one whose kets are simultaneous eigenvalues of the following set of observables: \\[\n\\{S_1^2,S_2^2,S^2,S_z\\}\n\\tag{28}\\] where:\n\n\\(\\mathbf{S}=\\mathbf{S}_1+\\mathbf{S}_2=(S_{1x}+S_{2x},S_{1y}+S_{2y},S_{1z}+S_{2z})\\) is the total spin operator.\n\\(S^2=S_x^2+S_y^2+S_z^2\\) is the magnitude squared operator.\n\\(S_z=S_{1z}+S_{2z}\\) is the \\(z\\)-component of \\(\\mathbf{S}\\).\n\nWhy this set of operators? The Hamiltonian we got in our hands (not shown in this notes) might commute with Equation 28 observables rather Equation 25 . Our goal is still to find the eigenstates of \\(H\\) and that is facilitated when we know operators that commute with it.\nSince \\(\\{S_1^2,S_2^2,S^2,S_z\\}\\) is a set of commuting observables, we can define a basis of kets which are eigenvector of all these observables; the basis is labelled by the eigenvalues (or better yet, by the indices that label the eigenvalues): \\[\n\\begin{align}\n&S_1^2\\ket{j_1,j_2;S,M}=S^2_2\\ket{j_1,j_2;S,M}=\\frac{3}{4} \\hbar^2\\ket{S,M}\\\\\n&S^2\\ket{j_1,j_2;S,M}=S(S+1)\\hbar^2\\ket{j_1,j_2;S,M}\\\\\n&S_z\\ket{j_1,j_2;S,M}=M\\hbar\\ket{j_1,j_2;S,M}\n\\end{align}\n\\]where \\(j_1=j_2=1/2\\) (we can drop them from the kets, since they are fixed and just use \\(|S,M\\rangle\\)). Notice the operators \\(S^2\\) and \\(S_z\\) are in fact angular momentum operators because they result from adding angular momentum, thus they are just another particular case of \\(J^2\\) and \\(J_z\\) that satisfy the commutation relation Equation 4, as a result their eigenvalues are of the form \\(S(S+1)\\hbar^2\\) and \\(M\\hbar\\) with \\(-S\\leq M\\leq S\\) as we have seen in Equation 7.\n\n\n\nGiven \\(j_1=j_2=1/2\\), we still do not know what values \\(S\\) and \\(M\\) take. But two things we know:\n\nFrom the theory of general angular momentum given in 4), we find \\(-S\\leq M\\leq S\\).\nKnowing that \\(S_z=S_{1z} + S_{2z}\\) tell us how to act with \\(S_z\\) on the old basis \\(\\{\\ket{1/2,1/2},\\ket{-1/2,1/2},\\ket{1/2,-1/2},\\ket{-1/2,-1/2}\\}\\), that suffices to show what values \\(M\\) take. For that we act with \\(S_z\\) on each ket of this basis. \\[\nS_z\\ket{m_1,m_2}=(S_{1z}+S_{2z})\\ket{m_1,m_2}=(m_1+m_2)\\hbar \\ket{m_1,m_2}\n\\tag{29}\\]\n\nFrom this we conclude that \\[\nM=m_1+m_2\n\\] Hence, the values \\(M\\) can take are: \\[\nM\\in\\{-1,0,+1\\}\n\\tag{30}\\]\nLets use this information: what values \\(S\\) have to take that guarantee that \\(M\\) takes the values Equation 30 ? Notice the question: If I know \\(S\\), we can easily get the range of \\(M\\) because we know that \\(-S\\leq M\\leq S\\). The present question goes the other way, if I know the \\(M\\)’s (and we know see Equation 30), what \\(S\\)’s are possible? We can answer this question by constructing a diagram consistent with the range of \\(M\\)’s, for example for the range Equation 30 the corresponding \\(S\\)’s are:\n\nWe can clearly see that \\(S=0,1\\) are all possible values consistent with Equation 30.\nRather than constructing this picture we can use the rule: \\[\n|j_1-j_2|\\leq S\\leq j_1+j_2\n\\]However the diagram not only showed us what are the values of \\(S\\), it also organizes pictorially the eigenbasis \\(\\{\\ket{S,M}\\}\\) generated by Equation 28, which in turn reveals two subspaces (pink boxes) where the raising and lowering operators \\(S_\\pm\\) are stuck.\n\n\n\nWe want to express the kets \\(\\ket{S,M}\\) of the new basis in terms of \\(\\ket{m_1,m_2}\\) that constitute the old basis, to do that we argue pictorially:\n\nOn the left side of the picture we see a graphical organization of the old basis and on the right side the new basis. We identify in each basis the elements that span the subspaces \\(\\mathcal{E}(M)\\) for each \\(M\\); this is easily done on the right picture because the horizontal axis already tells us the \\(M\\)’s, on the left picture these subspaces are diagonal because each basis ket is an eigenvector of \\(S_z\\) with eigenvalue \\(M\\hbar=(m_1+m_2)\\hbar\\).\nFrom the pictures we know: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\ket{S=1,M=1}\\in \\mathcal{E}(M=1)\\\\\n&\\ket{m_1=1/2,m_2=1/2}\\in \\mathcal{E}(M=1)\n\\end{align}\n\\] and since this subspace is one-dimensional, these two basis kets must coincide. We write: \\[\n\\ket{1,1}=\\ket{1/2,1/2}\n\\tag{31}\\]\nThis is a key step, since we just succeeded in establishing a first connection between both basis. The remaining connections follow from this one, as falling dominos, using the lower operator \\(S_-:=S_{1-}+S_{2-}\\) .\n\nActing with the lower operator on both sides of Equation 31 we find the next connection between these basis kets:\n\\[\nS_-\\ket{1,1}=(S_{1-}+S_{2-})\\ket{1/2,1/2}\n\\]\nThe left hand side gives us: \\[\n\\hbar\\sqrt{1(1+1)-0(0-1)}\\ket{1,0}\n\\] The right hand side is: \\[\n\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+1\\right)-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-1\\right)}\\left(\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}+\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)\n\\] Thus: \\[\n\\hbar\\sqrt{2}\\ket{1,0}=\\hbar\\left(\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}+\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)\n\\] Which yields the second connection between basis kets: \\[\n\\ket{1,0}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}+\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)\n\\] The third connection relates \\(|0,0\\rangle\\) with the old basis, to establish it, we use the properties of vector spaces:\n\nWe know \\(|0,0\\rangle\\) is a linear combination of \\(\\ket{-1/2,1/2}\\) and \\(\\ket{1/2,-1/2}\\) thus we write: \\[\n\\ket{0,0}=c_1\\ket{-1/2,1/2}+c_2\\ket{1/2,-1/2}\n\\] for some complex numbers \\(c_{1,2}\\).\nWe know \\(|0,0\\rangle\\) is orthogonal to \\(\\ket{1,0}\\), thus we write: \\[\n0=\\braket{1,0|0,0}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(c_1+c_2)\n\\]\nWe also know it is normalized, i.e., \\[\n1=\\braket{0,0|0,0}=|c_1|^2+|c_2|^2\n\\]\n\nSolving these three equations we conclude one possible solution is: \\[\nc_1=-c_2=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\] Hence, the second basis vector in \\(\\mathcal{E}(M=0)\\) is: \\[\n\\ket{0,0}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}-\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)\n\\] Finally, to get the last connection between the new and old basis, we act with either \\(S_-\\) on \\(\\ket{1,0}\\):\n\nOr we simply notice that \\(\\mathcal{E}(M=-1)\\) is also one dimensional and therefore: \\[\n\\ket{1,-1}=\\ket{-1/2,-1/2}\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe connection between the basis \\(\\{\\ket{S,M}\\}\\) of eigenstates of the set \\(\\{S_1^2,S_2^2;S^2,S_z\\}\\) and the basis \\(\\{\\ket{m_1,m_2}\\}\\) of eigenstates of the set \\(\\{S_1^2,S_{1z},S^2_2,S_{2z}\\}\\) given \\(S_1=S_2=1/2\\) is: \\[\n\\ket{0,0}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}-\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)\n\\] which spans the one dimension subspace \\(\\mathcal{E}(S=0)\\) and is thus called a singlet state; the three states of \\(\\mathcal{E}(S=1)\\) are called a triplet \\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\ket{1,1}=\\ket{1/2,1/2}\\\\\n&\\ket{1,0}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}+\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)\\\\\n&\\ket{1,-1}=\\ket{-1/2,-1/2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nIt is traditional to use the symbols \\(L_x\\), \\(L_y\\) ,\\(L_z\\) and \\(L^2\\) in place of \\(J_x\\), \\(J_y\\) ,\\(J_z\\) and \\(J^2\\) when speaking about the orbital angular momentum. Orbital angular momentum states live in \\(\\mathcal{E}(j)\\) subspaces with integer \\(j\\) in contrast with spin angular momentum which live in subspaces with semi-integers. See Figure 1.\nFrom Equation 7 we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}&L^2\\ket{l,m_l}=l(l+1)\\hbar^2\\ket{l,m},\\\\&L_z\\ket{l,m}=m\\hbar\\ket{l,m}.\\end{align}\n\\tag{32}\\]\nwith \\(l=0,1,2,...\\) and \\(-l\\leq m \\leq l\\).\nThe formulas Equation 32 together with the choice of the position basis \\(\\{|x,y,z\\rangle\\}\\) allow us to give their position representation:\n\\[ \\begin{align} &\\langle x,y,z|L^2\\ket{l,m}=l(l+1)\\hbar^2\\langle x,y,z|l,m\\rangle\\\\ &\\langle x,y,z|L_z\\ket{l,m}=m\\hbar\\langle x,y,z|l,m\\rangle \\end{align} \\]\nSubstituting Equation 2 we find:\n\\[ \\begin{align}&\\langle x,y,z|(L_x^2+L_y^2+L_z^2)\\ket{l,m}=l(l+1)\\hbar^2\\langle x,y,z|l,m\\rangle\\\\ &\\langle x,y,z|(XP_y-YP_x)\\ket{l,m}=m\\hbar\\langle x,y,z|l,m\\rangle\\end{align}  \\tag{33}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall\n\n\n\nThe \\(X\\) and \\(P_x\\) operators have the following representation in the \\(\\{|x\\rangle\\}\\) basis:\n\\[ \\langle x|X|\\psi\\rangle = x\\langle x|\\psi\\rangle \\qquad \\langle x|P_x|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\langle x|\\psi\\rangle \\]\n\n\nFrom the second equation in Equation 33 we find:\n\\[ \\begin{align} \\langle x,y,z|L_z|\\psi\\rangle &= \\langle x,y,z|(XP_y-YP_x)|\\psi\\rangle\\\\ &= \\langle x,y,z|(xP_y-yP_x)|\\psi\\rangle\\\\ &= \\langle x,y,z|(x\\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}-y\\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x})|\\psi\\rangle\\\\ &= \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\left(x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}-y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right)\\langle x,y,z|\\psi\\rangle\\\\ &= \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\left(x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}-y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right)\\psi(x,y,z) \\end{align} \\] Therefore, in the position basis, the \\(L_z\\) operator acts on functions \\(\\psi(x,y,z)\\) as the operation:\n\\[ L_z \\rightsquigarrow \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\left(x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}-y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right)  \\tag{34}\\]\nSimilarly we find:\n\\[ L_x \\rightsquigarrow \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\left(y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}-z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right) \\qquad L_y \\rightsquigarrow \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\left(z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}-x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right)  \\tag{35}\\]\nIt will be useful to change from cartesian coordinates \\(x,y,z\\) into polar coordinates \\(r,\\theta,\\phi\\). The map between these coordinates is established by the equations:\n\\[ \\begin{align} & x = r \\sin \\theta \\cos \\phi\\\\ & y = r \\sin \\theta \\sin \\phi\\\\ & z = r \\cos \\theta \\end{align} \\]\nprovided \\(r\\geq 0\\), \\(0\\leq\\theta\\leq\\pi\\) and \\(0\\leq\\phi&lt; 2\\pi\\).\nTo convert Equation 34 and Equation 35 into polar coordinates we proceed as follows:\n\nDraw a diagram:\n\n\n\nRelate the derivatives in cartesian and polar coordinates encoded in the diagram:\n\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial_r\\psi\\\\ \\partial_\\theta\\psi\\\\ \\partial_\\phi\\psi \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial_r x & \\partial_r y & \\partial_r z\\\\ \\partial_\\theta x & \\partial_\\theta y & \\partial_\\theta z\\\\ \\partial_\\phi x & \\partial_\\phi y & \\partial_\\phi z \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial_x\\psi\\\\ \\partial_y \\psi\\\\ \\partial_z \\psi \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nCompute the matrix (Easy)\n\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi & \\sin\\theta \\sin \\phi & \\cos\\theta\\\\ r \\cos\\theta \\cos\\phi & r \\cos\\theta \\sin \\phi & -r \\sin \\theta\\\\ -r\\sin\\theta \\sin \\phi & r \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi & 0 \\end{pmatrix}  \\tag{36}\\]\n\nInvert the system Equation 36 (Hard, use Mathematica)\n\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial_x\\psi\\\\ \\partial_y\\psi\\\\ \\partial_z\\psi \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta \\cos \\phi   & r^{-1}\\cos\\theta \\cos\\phi & -(r\\sin\\theta)^{-1} \\sin\\phi\\\\ \\sin\\theta \\sin \\phi   & r^{-1}\\cos\\theta \\sin\\phi & (r\\sin\\theta)^{-1} \\cos\\phi\\\\ \\cos\\theta & -r^{-1}\\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial_r\\psi\\\\ \\partial_\\theta \\psi\\\\ \\partial_\\phi \\psi \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nSubstitute the results into Equation 34 and Equation 35 and simplify:\n\\[ \\begin{align} &L_x \\rightsquigarrow i\\hbar\\left(\\sin\\phi \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}+\\frac{\\cos\\phi}{\\tan\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\right)\\\\ &L_y \\rightsquigarrow i\\hbar\\left(-\\cos\\phi \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}+\\frac{\\sin\\phi}{\\tan\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\right)\\\\ &Lz \\rightsquigarrow \\frac{\\hbar}{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} \\end{align} \\]\nFrom these results we can now derive the action of \\(L^2\\) in polar coordinates:\n\\[ \\begin{align} L^2\\psi &= L_x^2\\psi + L_y^2\\psi+L_z^2\\psi\\\\ &=(i\\hbar)^2\\left(\\sin\\phi \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}+\\frac{\\cos\\phi}{\\tan\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\right)^2\\psi +(i\\hbar)^2\\left(-\\cos\\phi \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}+\\frac{\\sin\\phi}{\\tan\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\right)^2\\psi+ \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\phi^2}\\psi \\end{align}  \\tag{37}\\] Now we need to expand each square, the first becomes:\n\n\\[ (i\\hbar)^2\\left(\\sin^2\\phi \\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial \\theta^2}+ \\frac{\\cos^2\\phi}{\\tan^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial \\phi^2}-\\frac{\\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi}{\\sin^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\phi}+\\frac{\\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi}{\\tan\\theta}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial\\theta\\partial \\phi}\\right) \\]\nthe second term becomes:\n\\[ (i\\hbar)^2\\left(\\cos^2\\phi \\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial \\theta^2}+ \\frac{\\sin^2\\phi}{\\tan^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial \\phi^2}+\\frac{\\cos\\phi\\sin\\phi}{\\sin^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\phi}-\\frac{\\cos\\phi\\sin\\phi}{\\tan\\theta}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial\\theta\\partial \\phi}\\right) \\]\nSubstituting into Equation 37 and canceling terms yields the final result:\n\\[ L^2 \\rightsquigarrow -\\hbar^2\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\theta^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\theta} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\phi^2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan\\theta}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\right) \\]\nAs a consequence, the system of equations in Equation 33 becomes a system of partial differential equations:\n\\[ \\begin{align} &-\\hbar^2 \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta^2}+\\frac{1}{\\tan \\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}+\\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial^2 \\phi^2}\\right)\\psi_{l,m}(r, \\theta, \\phi)=l(l+1)\\hbar^2\\psi_{l,m}(r, \\theta, \\phi)\\\\ & \\frac{\\hbar}{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\psi_{l,m}(r, \\theta, \\phi)=m\\hbar \\psi_{l,m}(r, \\theta, \\phi) \\end{align} \\]\nThe solutions \\(\\psi_{l,m}(r,\\theta,\\phi)\\) are the eigenfunctions common to the \\(L^2\\) and \\(L_z\\) operators associated with the eigenvalues \\(l(l+1)\\hbar^2\\) and \\(m\\hbar\\). These solution exist because these two operators commute. Our ultimate goal is to solve them, but in these notes we’ll content ourselves by just identifying some of its properties.\n\n\n\nSuppose our system of two electrons is described by states in \\(\\mathcal{E}(S=1)\\) (see triplet states in 13)) and we want to add to it another electron, which obviously is described by states in \\(\\mathcal{E}(j_3=1/2)\\). How are we going to describe the quantum states of the three particles?\nIn 10)-14) we had one electron living in \\(\\mathcal{E}(j_1=1/2)\\) and added to it another electron, which was, as usual, in some state in \\(\\mathcal{E}(j_2=1/2)\\). Back then:\n\nwe constructed a tensor product basis for \\(\\mathcal{E}(j_1=1/2)\\otimes \\mathcal{E}(j_2=1/2)\\) to describe the states of the two electrons\nintroduced a new and more convenient basis\nwe connected both basis\n\nOur goal in this section is analogous, we will start to construct a basis for the tensor product space \\(\\mathcal{E}(S=1)\\otimes \\mathcal{E}(j_3=1/2)\\), then introduce a more convenient basis and finally connect the new with the old.\n\n\nWe note that the CSCO that is about to generate a basis for \\(\\mathcal{E}(S_{12}=1)\\otimes \\mathcal{E}(j_3=1/2)\\) is given by \\[\n\\{\\overbrace{S_1^2,S_2^2}^\\text{background};\\overbrace{S_{12}^2,S_{12}^z}^\\text{1st spin},\\overbrace{S_3^2,S_3^z}^\\text{2ndspin}\\}\n\\] We can split this set into three parts:\n\n1st spin angular momentum: the main operators that we need to specify the state of the two first electrons in the system are \\(S_{12}^2\\) and \\(S_{12}^z\\).\nbackground: how do we know we added two electron? To answer that we need two extra operators, \\(S_1^2\\) and \\(S_2^2\\), to provide background information on what spins where added. By including these in the CSCO, the eigenkets will include \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\) which when set as equal to \\(1/2\\) automatically says, these are two electron spin we did add.\n2nd spin angular momentum: The main operators for the third electron are \\(S_3^2\\) and \\(S_3^z\\).\n\nThese six operators commute among each other and as a result we can define a basis of eigenvectors common to all the observables, which are indexed by the corresponding quantum numbers:\n\\[\n\\ket{s_1,s_2;S_{12},M_{12},s_3,m_3}\n\\] What do we know about these states?\n\n\\(s_1=s_2=1/2\\) because the 1st spin result from adding two electron spins.\n\\(0=|s_1-s_2|\\leq S_{12}\\leq s_1+s_2=1\\) in steps of \\(1\\)\n\\(-1\\leq M_{12}\\leq 1\\)\n\\(s_3=1/2\\)\n\\(-1/2\\leq m_3\\leq 1/2\\)\n\\(\\ket{s_1,s_2;S_{12},M_{12},s_3,m_3}:=\\ket{s_1,s_2;S_{12},M_{12}}\\otimes\\ket{s_3,m_3}\\)\nMoreover we know the ket \\(\\ket{s_1,s_2;S_{12},M_{12}}\\) can be written in terms of the individual states of electron \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) either as a singlet or triplet state, see 14). Since we opted for \\(S_{12}=1\\) this state be one of the triplet states.\n\nGiven \\(S_{12}=1\\) and \\(s_3=1/2\\) we can organize this basis (which we call the old basis) with the following picture:\n\n\n\nThe old basis.\n\n\nLets us now change the basis of our tensor product space, for that we choose the new CSCO: \\[\n\\{\\overbrace{S_1^2,S_2^2,S_3^2,S_{12}^2}^\\text{background};\\overbrace{S_{tot}^2,S_{tot}^z}^\\text{total spin}\\}\n\\] whose eigenbasis is defined as usual by the quantum numbers determining each eigenvalue of the observables in the set: \\[\n\\ket{s_1,s_2,s_3,S_{12};S_{tot},M_{tot}}\n\\]\nSpecifically we are interested in the basis states which have \\[\ns_1=s_2=s_3=1/2\\qquad S_{12}=1\n\\]\nbecause we did add three electron spins and the first two are in state belonging to \\(\\mathcal{E}(S_{12}=1)\\). Note this subspace is my choice, we could had chosen \\(\\mathcal{E}(S_{12}=0)\\), see 13). This is the new basis.\nThe operators \\(S_{tot}^2\\) and \\(S_{tot}^z\\) describe the magnitude and the \\(z-\\)component of the total angular momentum, and we know from the general rules of angular momentum in 4) that the following relation holds: \\[\n-S_{tot}\\leq M_{tot}\\leq S_{tot}\n\\] We do not know the values of \\(S_{tot}\\) are, yet, just like we did not know what were the values of \\(S_{12}\\) when we added the systems 1+2 in 12). But we can guess what they are from the possible values of \\(M_{tot}\\), just as we did to guess what \\(S_{12}\\) was from the known values of \\(M=m_1+m_2\\), see 12).\nSince the kets of the old basis are also eigenvectors of \\(S_{tot}^z\\), let us act with this operator on the old basis to get the corresponding eigenvalues \\(M_{tot}\\), the calculations are analogous to Equation 29; we summarize the results by the pink boxes in the following picture:\n\nKnowing that \\(M_{tot}=-3/2,-1/2,1/2,3/2\\) and the fact that these numbers must be between \\(-S_{tot}\\) and \\(S_{tot}\\) we attempt to reconstruct the diagram that organizes the basis:\n\nFrom the picture we conclude we must have either \\(S_{tot}=1/2,3/2\\) and we confirm again the general rule: \\[\n1/2=|S_{12}-s_3|\\leq S_{tot}\\leq S_{12}+s_3=3/2\\qquad \\text{in steps of }1\n\\] Let us now relate the old basis on the left with the new basis on the right, the idea is exactly the same as in 13):\n\nThe two subspaces \\(\\mathcal{E}(M_{tot}=3/2)\\) are one dimensional and thus: \\[\n\\ket{S_{tot}=3/2,M_{tot}=3/2}=\\ket{M_{12}=1}\\otimes\\ket{m_3=1/2}\n\\]The ket on the lhs which previously was just a ket with indices of the eigenvalues, now has meaning, it is equal to the tensor product on the rhs.\nActing now with the lowering operator \\(S_{tot}^-=S_{12}^-+S_1^-\\) on this equality we find: \\[\nS_{tot}^-\n\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{3}{2}}=\\hbar\\sqrt{3}\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\] The right side of the equality is: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nS_{tot}^-\n\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{3}{2}}&=(S_{12}^-+S_1^-)(\\ket{1}\\otimes\\ket{\\frac{1}{2}})\\\\\n&=\\hbar\\sqrt{2}\\ket{0}\\otimes\\ket{\\frac{1}{2}}+\\hbar\\ket{1}\\otimes\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\end{align}\n\\] Therefore we conclude: \\[\n\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\ket{0}\\otimes\\ket{\\frac{1}{2}}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\ket{1}\\otimes\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\] We now seek to relate the eigenvector \\(\\ket{S_{tot}=1/2,M_{tot}=1/2}\\) with the old basis, we do that by writing its properties:\n\nit must be a linear combination of the form: \\[\n    \\ket{S_{tot}=1/2,M_{tot}=1/2}=\\alpha \\ket{0}\\otimes\\ket{\\frac{1}{2}} + \\beta \\ket{1}\\otimes\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n    \\]\nit must normalized: \\[\n|\\alpha|^2+|\\beta|^2=1\n\\]\nit must be perpendicular to \\(\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}\\) .\n\nA pair of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) that satisfy all the above constraints yields: \\[\n\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\ket{0}\\otimes\\ket{\\frac{1}{2}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} \\ket{1}\\otimes\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\] We can continue now and act with \\(S_{tot}^-\\) on \\(\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}\\) to get us \\(\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}\\); we find: \\[\n\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\ket{-1}\\otimes\\ket{\\frac{1}{2}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\ket{0}\\otimes\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\] The ket \\(\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}\\) is found from its properties just as we did for \\(\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}\\): \\[\n\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\ket{-1}\\otimes\\ket{\\frac{1}{2}}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\ket{0}\\otimes\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\] Finally we are left with: \\[\n\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},-\\frac{3}{2}}=\\ket{-1}\\otimes\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\] since the subspace \\(\\mathcal{E}(M_{tot}=-3/2)\\) is one dimensional.\n\n\n\n\nThe eigenbasis of the CSCO \\(\\{S_1^2,S_2^2,S_3^2,S_{12}^2;S_{tot}^2,S_{tot}^z\\}\\) is related with the eigenbasis of the CSCO \\(\\{S_1^2,S_2^2;S_{12}^2,S_{12}^z,S_3^2,S_3^z\\}\\) as:\n\n\\(\\mathcal{E}(M_{12}=3/2)\\) \\[\n\\ket{S_{tot}=3/2,M_{tot}=3/2}=\\ket{M_{12}=1}\\otimes\\ket{m_3=1/2}\n\\]\n\\(\\mathcal{E}(M_{12}=1/2)\\) \\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\ket{S_{tot}=\\frac{3}{2},M_{tot}=\\frac{1}{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\ket{M_{12}=0}\\otimes\\ket{m_3=\\frac{1}{2}}+\\\\\n&\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\ket{M_{12}=1}\\otimes\\ket{m_3=-\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\\n&\\ket{S_{tot}=\\frac{1}{2},M_{tot}=\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\ket{M_{12}=0}\\otimes\\ket{m_3=\\frac{1}{2}} -\\\\\n&\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} \\ket{M_{12}=1}\\otimes\\ket{m_3=-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\\(\\mathcal{E}(M_{12}=-1/2)\\) \\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\ket{S_{tot}=\\frac{3}{2},M_{tot}=-\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\ket{M_{12}=-1}\\otimes\\ket{m_3=\\frac{1}{2}}+\\\\\n&\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\ket{M_{12}=0}\\otimes\\ket{m_3=-\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\\n&\\ket{S_{tot}=\\frac{1}{2},M_{tot}-\\frac{1}{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\ket{M_{12}=-1}\\otimes\\ket{m_3=\\frac{1}{2}}-\\\\\n&\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\ket{M_{12}=0}\\otimes\\ket{m_3=-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\\(\\mathcal{E}(M_{12}=-3/2)\\) \\[\n\\ket{S_{tot}=\\frac{3}{2},M_{tot}=-\\frac{3}{2}}=\\ket{M_{12}=-1}\\otimes\\ket{m_3=-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\] In turn we must now replace the basis kets \\(\\ket{S_{12}=1,M_{12}}\\) by the elements of the triplet from 14) if you want to relate the new basis with the basis generated by the CSCO\n\\[\n\\{S_1^2,S_1^z;S_2^2,S_2^z;S_3^2,S_3^z\\}\n\\]"

We write: \\[\n\\ket{1,1}=\\ket{1/2,1/2}\n\\] We just succeeded in establishing the first connection of both basis, more, the remaining connections follow from this one, as falling dominos. Using the lower operator defined as \\(S_-:=S_{1-}+S_{2-}\\) we find \\(\\ket{1,0}\\):\n\n\\[\nS_-\\ket{1,1}=(S_{1-}+S_{2-})\\ket{1/2,1/2}\n\\]\nThe left hand side gives us: \\[\n\\hbar\\sqrt{1(1+1)-0(0-1)}\\ket{1,0}\n\\] The right hand side is: \\[\n\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+1\\right)-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-1\\right)}\\left(\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}+\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)\n\\] Thus: \\[\n\\hbar\\sqrt{2}\\ket{1,0}=\\hbar\\left(\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}+\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)\n\\] Which yields: \\[\n\\ket{1,0}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}+\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)\n\\] In \\(\\mathcal{E}(M=1)\\) there is still \\(\\ket{0,0}\\), we use its properties to derive the connection:\n\nWe know it is a linear combination of \\(\\ket{-1/2,1/2}\\) and \\(\\ket{1/2,-1/2}\\) thus we write: \\[\n\\ket{0,0}=c_1\\ket{-1/2,1/2}+c_2\\ket{1/2,-1/2}\n\\] for some complex numbers \\(c_{1,2}\\).\nWe know it is orthogonal to \\(\\ket{1,0}\\), thus we write: \\[\n0=\\braket{1,0|0,0}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(c_1+c_2)\n\\]\nWe also know it is normalized, i.e., \\[\n1=\\braket{0,0|0,0}=|c_1|^2+|c_2|^2\n\\]\n\nSolving these equations we conclude one possible solution is: \\[\nc_1=-c_2=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\] Hence, the second basis vector in \\(\\mathcal{E}(M=0)\\) is: \\[\n\\ket{0,0}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}-\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)\n\\] Finally, to get the last connection between the new and old basis, we act with either \\(S_-\\) on \\(\\ket{1,0}\\):\n\nOr we simply notice that \\(\\mathcal{E}(M=-1)\\) is also one dimensional and therefore: \\[\n\\ket{1,-1}=\\ket{-1/2,-1/2}\n\\]"

On the other hand we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&J_x := YP_z-ZP_y\\\\\n&J_y:=ZP_x-XP_z\\\\\n&J_z:= XP_y-YP_x \\\\\n&J^2:=J_x^2+J_y^2+J_z^2\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{24}\\]\nThe commutation relations Equation 3 and Equation 5 that we assumed in previous sections for the symbols on the lhs of Equation 24 also hold for the symbols on the rhs\nIn other words, the explicit form of \\(J_x\\), \\(J_y\\) and \\(J_z\\) that we defined in Equation 24, by itself satisfies Equation 3 and Equation 5 provided:\n\\[\n[X,P_x] = [Y,P_y] = [Z,P_z]=i\\hbar\n\\]\nAs an example:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n[J_x,J_y]&=[YP_z-ZP_y,ZP_x-XP_z]\\\\\n&=[YP_z,ZP_x]-[YP_z,XP_z]-[ZP_y,ZP_x]+[ZP_y,XP_z]\\\\\n&=Y[P_z,Z]P_x -0-0+X[Z,P_z]P_y\\\\\n&=-i\\hbar YP_x+i\\hbar XP_y\\\\\n&=i\\hbar (XP_y-YP_x)\\\\\n&=i\\hbar J_z\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{25}\\]\njust as we assumed in Equation 3 . Analogous calculation show our definitions satisfies the remaining commutation relations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange of Notation\n\n\n\nIt is traditional to use the symbols \\(L_x\\), \\(L_y\\) ,\\(L_z\\) and \\(L^2\\) in place of \\(J_x\\), \\(J_y\\) ,\\(J_z\\) and \\(J^2\\) when speaking about the orbital angular momentum. Recall the former notation is used for a generic angular momentum, not necessarily the orbital one.\n\n\nThe rhs of Equation 24 together with the choice of the position basis \\(\\{|x,y,z\\rangle\\}\\) allow us to give the position representation of the eigenvalue-eigenvector equations we saw in ?@eq-J2andJzevalevecteqn:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\langle x,y,z|L^2\\ket{l,m}=l(l+1)\\hbar^2\\langle x,y,z|\\ket{l,m}\\\\\n&\\langle x,y,z|L_z\\ket{l,m}=m\\hbar\\langle x,y,z|\\ket{l,m}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{26}\\]\nSubstituting Equation 24 we find:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}&\\langle x,y,z|(L_x^2+L_y^2+L_z^2)\\ket{l,m}=l(l+1)\\hbar^2\\langle x,y,z|\\ket{l,m}\\\\\n&\\langle x,y,z|(XP_y-YP_x)\\ket{l,m}=m\\hbar\\langle x,y,z|\\ket{l,m}\\end{align}\n\\tag{27}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall\n\n\n\nThe \\(X\\) and \\(P_x\\) operators have the following representation in the \\(\\{|x\\rangle\\}\\) basis:\n\\[\n\\langle x|X|\\psi\\rangle = x\\langle x|\\psi\\rangle \\qquad \\langle x|P_x|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\langle x|\\psi\\rangle\n\\]\n\n\nThe second equation in Equation 27 we find:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\langle x,y,z|L_z|\\psi\\rangle &= \\langle x,y,z|(XP_y-YP_x)|\\psi\\rangle\\\\\n&= \\langle x,y,z|(xP_y-yP_x)|\\psi\\rangle\\\\\n&= \\langle x,y,z|(x\\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}-y\\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x})|\\psi\\rangle\\\\\n&= \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\left(x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}-y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right)\\langle x,y,z|\\psi\\rangle\\\\\n&= \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\left(x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}-y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right)\\psi(x,y,z)\n\\end{align}\n\\] Therefore, in the position basis, the \\(L_z\\) operator acts on functions \\(\\psi(x,y,z)\\) as the operation:\n\\[\nL_z \\rightsquigarrow \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\left(x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}-y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right)\n\\tag{28}\\]\nSimilarly we find:\n\\[\nL_x \\rightsquigarrow \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\left(y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}-z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right) \\qquad L_y \\rightsquigarrow \\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\left(z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}-x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right)\n\\tag{29}\\]\nWe could substitute the rhs of Equation 28 and Equation 29 into the commutation relations and run an analogous calculation to Equation 25, the would conclude that they indeed satisfy those equations as well.\nIt will be useful to change from cartesian coordinates \\(x,y,z\\) into polar coordinates \\(r,\\theta,\\phi\\).

    "text": "Angular momentum in QM\nClassical angular momentum is defined as \\[\n\\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{r}\\times \\mathbf{p}\n\\]\nwhere for example, the last component of \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) is \\[\nL_z=xp_y-p_yx.\n\\]To obtain the QM angular momentum we replace the positions coordinates \\(x,y,z\\) and momentum \\(p_x,p_y,p_z\\) by the operators \\(X,Y,Z\\) and \\(P_x,P_y,P_z\\). This gives us:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{R}\\times \\mathbf{P}\n\\]where \\(\\mathbf{R}=(X,Y,Z)\\) and \\(\\mathbf{P}=(P_x,P_y,P_z)\\) are vectors whose entries are operators. From the three components of \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) we can derive the following commutations relations:\n\\[\n[L_x,L_y]=i\\hbar L_z\\qquad [L_y,L_z]=i\\hbar L_x\\qquad [L_z,L_x]=i\\hbar L_y\\qquad [L_i,L_j]=0\\quad \\text{for}\\ i\\not= j\n\\]\nfrom the canonical ones:\n\\[\n[X,P_x]=i\\hbar \\qquad [Y,P_y]=i\\hbar \\qquad [Z,P_z]=i\\hbar\n\\]\nFrom a different perspective we can say that the angular momentum operators satisfy these three commutation “equations”. In QM one wants to talk about more general angular momentum, for example spin angular momentum, it has no classical analog and hence is not defined explicitly as \\(\\mathbf{r}\\times \\mathbf{p}\\). However one can still define it implicitly, by saying that whatever spin angular momentum operator is, it must satisfy the previous three commutations relation. Hence we introduce a general angular momentum \\(J\\) which obeys the rules\n\\[\n[J_x,J_y]=i\\hbar J_z\\qquad [J_y,J_z]=i\\hbar J_x\\qquad [J_z,J_x]=i\\hbar J_y\\qquad [J_i,J_j]=0\\quad \\text{for}\\ i\\not= j\n\\tag{1}\\]\n\\(\\mathbf{J}\\) can be either the orbital angular momentum of a particle or the spin angular momentum or a combination of these, since all quantum angular momenta has commutation relations of that form. Given \\(\\mathbf{J}\\) we can introduce now its norm squared \\(J^2\\), defined as:\n\\[\nJ^2=J_x^2+J_y^2+J_z^2\n\\]\nMoreover, we can easily show from Equation 1 that this operator commute with the three components of \\(\\mathbf{J}\\):\n\\[\n[J^2,J_x]=0\\qquad[J^2,J_y]=0\\qquad[J^2,J_z]=0\n\\tag{2}\\]\nfor example, using Equation 1 we find:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n[J^2,J_z]&=[J_x^2+J_y^2+J_z^2,J_z]\\\\\n&=[J_x^2,J_z]+[J_y^2,J_z]+[J_z^2,J_z]\\\\\n&=0+0+0\\\\\n&=0\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThat fact that \\(J^2\\) commutes with \\(J_z\\) will be of great importance, because it guarantees one can find (and thus define) a set of basis kets in the Hilbert space that are simultaneously eigenstates of both. Moreover, since the commuting operators are hermitian (we say in QM they are observables) the eigenstates of the operators can be made orthogonal and the eigenvalues are real."

Let us see now what happens when \\(J_x\\) acts on the second basis ket \\(|1,0\\rangle\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nJ_x|1,0\\rangle &= \\frac{1}{2}(J_++J_-)|1,0\\rangle\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sqrt{1(1+1)-0(0+1)}|1,1\\rangle+\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sqrt{1(1+1)-0(0-1)}|1,1\\rangle|1,-1\\rangle\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}(|1,1\\rangle+|1,-1\\rangle)\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{9}\\]\nAs \\(J_x\\) acts on \\(|1,0\\rangle\\) it gives a linear combination \\(|1,1\\rangle+|1,-1\\rangle\\) of basis vectors, which in turn also lives in \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1)\\).\nAnd finally,a similar calculation would shows the action on the third ket is:\n\\[\nJ_x|1,-1\\rangle =\\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}|1,0\\rangle\n\\tag{10}\\]\nAgain, the input \\(|1,-1\\rangle\\) is in \\(\\mathcal {E}(j=1)\\) and so is the output \\(|1,0\\rangle\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\n\n\n\nThe calculation above show clearly that the the operator \\(J_x\\) maps the basis of \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1)\\) into vectors in that subspace. Therefore, in general it will map any ket of \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1)\\) into another in \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1)\\); the jargon for this observation is to say that “\\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1)\\) is globally invariant under the action of \\(J_x\\)”; more colloquially we just say “the action of \\(J_x\\) is stuck in the subspace”. These calculation confirm the prediction already made from the fact that \\([J^2,J_x]=0\\).\n\n\nThe results in Equation 8, Equation 9 and Equation 10 allow us to write:\n\\[\nJ_x = \\sum_{m,m'=1,0,-1}|1,m\\rangle\\langle1,m|J_x|1,m'\\rangle\\langle1,m'|\n\\]\nexplicitly as: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nJ_x &= \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(|1,0\\rangle\\langle 1,1|+|1,1\\rangle\\langle 1,0|+|1,-1\\rangle\\langle 1,0|+|1,0\\rangle\\langle 1,-1|\\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhich in turn can be rewritten using using matrix notation. If we agree to order for the basis kets as \\(\\{|1,1\\rangle, |10\\rangle,|1,-1\\rangle\\}\\) we find:\n\nRepeating these calculation for \\(J_y\\) and \\(J_z\\) yields the results:\n\nThe matrix for \\(J_z\\) is diagonal since the basis elements we choose fo \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1)\\) are its eigenvectors, the diagonal elements are the the three \\(m\\hbar\\) eigenvalues for \\(m=1,0,-1\\); and since they are also eigenvectors of \\(J^2\\) we find a diagonal with the \\(1(1+1)\\hbar^2=2\\hbar^2\\) eigenvalues repeated three times:"

See the Conclusion at the end.\nThe basis states of a system of two electrons such as the helium atom (2 electrons orbiting a nucleus) are of the form:\n\\[\n|n, l, m, m_s; n', l', m', m_s'\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1-P_{21})(|1:n, l, m, m_s; 2: n', l',m',m_s'\\rangle)\n\\tag{21}\\]\nwhere \\(P_{21}\\) permutes the \\(1\\), \\(2\\) indices. The \\(n\\) is the principal quantum number, \\(l\\) together with \\(m\\) describes the orbit angular momentum of the first electron, finally \\(m_s\\) together with the suppressed \\(s=1/2\\) determines its spin angular momentum. The primed indices describe the second electron.\nSince both electron have semi-integer spin \\(s=s'=1/2\\) the quantum states \\(|n, l, m, m_s; n', l', m', m_s'\\rangle\\) must be antisymmetric for the exchange of particles.\nThe operator \\(1-P_{21}\\) acting on the tensor product ket \\(|1:n, l, m, m_s; 2: n', l',m',m_s'\\rangle\\) makes Equation 21 antisymmetric.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall\n\n\n\nBy definition \\(|1:\\phi;2:\\psi\\rangle := |1:\\phi\\rangle \\otimes |2:\\psi\\rangle\\). (example: \\(\\phi=n,l,m,m_s\\) and \\(\\psi=n',l',m',m_s'\\))\nThe state \\((1+P_{21})|1:\\phi;2:\\psi\\rangle\\) is equal to \\(|1:\\phi;2:\\psi\\rangle + |1:\\psi;2:\\phi\\rangle\\), which is symmetric because exchange of \\(1\\rightarrow 2\\) leaves the ket unchanged:\n\\[\nP_{21} (|1:\\phi;2:\\psi\\rangle + |1:\\psi;2:\\phi\\rangle) = |1:\\phi;2:\\psi\\rangle + |1:\\psi;2:\\phi\\rangle\n\\]\nOn the other hand \\((1-P_{21})|1:\\phi;2:\\psi\\rangle\\) is equal to \\(|1:\\phi;2:\\psi\\rangle - |1:\\psi;2:\\phi\\rangle\\) which is antissymetric because a minus sign emerges from the permutation of indices:\n\\[\nP_{21} (|1:\\phi;2:\\psi\\rangle - |1:\\psi;2:\\phi\\rangle) = -(|1:\\phi;2:\\psi\\rangle - |1:\\psi;2:\\phi\\rangle)\n\\]\nIf the two particles where in the same state \\(\\phi=\\psi\\) then:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&(1+P_{21})|1:\\phi;2:\\phi\\rangle = 2 |1:\\phi;2:\\phi\\rangle\\\\\n&(1-P_{21})|1:\\phi;2:\\phi\\rangle = 0\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nHence, the operator \\(1-P_{21}\\) prevents the two states to be equal, by reducing them to zero.\nThe operator \\(1\\pm P_{21}\\) is the mathematical agent that ensures the Pauli Exclusion Principle is obeyed. The \\(+\\) is applyed for boson i.e. for integer \\(j\\) particles; the \\(-\\) is applied for fermions, i.e., for particles with semi-integer \\(j\\).\n\n\nSince the spins are semi-integers \\(s=s'=1/2\\), by Pauli Exclusion Principle states that: two electrons in the same quantum, i.e., the primed and unprimed indices are equal \\(n=n'\\), \\(l=l'\\), \\(m=m'\\) and \\(m_s=m_s'\\), these states are not physical, meaning their wave function is \\(0\\). By writing Equation 21 where we find the operator \\(1-P_{21}\\), we render this ket to \\(0\\) if those indices are equal; and non-zero otherwise.\nA non-zero state is for example the case \\(n=n'=1\\), \\(l=l'=m=m'=0\\) and \\(m_s=\\uparrow\\) and \\(m_s'=\\downarrow\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n|1,0,0,\\uparrow;1,0,0,\\downarrow\\rangle &=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1-P_{21})(|1:1, 0, 0, \\uparrow; 2: 1, 0,0,\\downarrow\\rangle)\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|1:1, 0, 0, \\uparrow; 2: 1, 0,0,\\downarrow\\rangle-|1:1, 0, 0, \\downarrow; 2: 1, 0,0,\\uparrow\\rangle)\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\underbrace{|1:1, 0, 0; 2: 1,0,0\\rangle}_\\text{spacial part}\\otimes(\\underbrace{|1:\\uparrow;2:\\downarrow\\rangle-|1:\\downarrow;2:\\uparrow\\rangle}_\\text{spin part})\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{22}\\]\nObserving the right hand side of Equation 22 we notice it has two parts:\n\nthe spacial part is symmetric for the exchange of indices, just apply \\(P_{21}\\) and we get a plus sign on the right hand side:\n\n\\[\nP_{21}|1:1, 0, 0; 2: 1,0,0\\rangle = |1:1, 0, 0; 2: 1,0,0\\rangle\n\\]\n\nthe spin part is antisymmetric, notice the minus sign:\n\n\\[\nP_{21} (|1:\\uparrow;2:\\downarrow\\rangle-|1:\\downarrow;2:\\uparrow\\rangle) = - (|1:\\uparrow;2:\\downarrow\\rangle-|1:\\downarrow;2:\\uparrow\\rangle)\n\\]\nAs a result the whole state Equation 22 acquires a minus sign when we switch \\(1\\) with \\(2\\) and it is considered antisymmetric:\n\\[\nP_{21} |1,0,0,1/2;1,0,0,-1/2\\rangle = - |1,0,0,1/2;1,0,0,-1/2\\rangle\n\\]\nConclusion: This simple example of the helium atom showed that the basis of the helium electrons are antissymetric kets of the form \\(\\text{space}\\otimes\\text{spin}\\). This example also showed us how PEP for fermions is incorporated mathematically into the ket states through \\(1-P_{12}\\), which makes the whole ket antissymetric. The whole ket includes the spacial and spin parts.\nI emphasize that neither the spacial or spin part have to necessarily be antissymetric, what is needed is that the whole state be antissymetric, and it must be so, because we are dealing with two semi-integer spin particles and PEP says so.\nFinally, since the basis of the helium atom we can split the spatial and spin parts, we will now devote the next sections focusing just on the spin part."

From then we can now write the corresponding matrix representation, but:\nFirst step: write the identity of \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1)\\):\n\\[\n1 = \\sum_{m=-1,0,1} |1,m\\rangle\\langle1,m|\n\\]\nSecond step: write \\(J_x\\) between the identities:\n\n\\[\nJ_x = \\sum_{m,m'=1,0,-1}|1,m\\rangle\\langle1,m|J_x|1,m'\\rangle\\langle1,m'|\n\\tag{15}\\]\n\nThird step: substitute Equation 14 in Equation 15:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nJ_x &= \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(|1,0\\rangle\\langle 1,1|+|1,1\\rangle\\langle 1,0|+|1,-1\\rangle\\langle 1,0|+|1,0\\rangle\\langle 1,-1|\\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{16}\\]\nFourth, write Equation 16 using using matrix notation. If we agree to order the basis as \\(\\{|1,1\\rangle, |1,0\\rangle,|1,-1\\rangle\\}\\) we find:\n\n\nWe can name this matrix as \\([J_x]_\\mathcal{B}\\), thenotation remind us: this is a matrix representing the action of \\(J_x\\) in the \\(\\mathcal{B}\\)! The squiggly arrow just mean: “it is represented by”.\nRepeating these steps for \\(J_y\\) and \\(J_z\\) yields the results:\n\nThe matrix \\([J_z]_\\mathcal{B}\\) is diagonal since the basis elements we choose for \\(\\mathcal{E}(j=1)\\) are its eigenvectors, the diagonal elements are the the three \\(m\\hbar\\) eigenvalues \\(m=1,0,-1\\). Since they are also eigenvectors of \\(J^2\\) we find a diagonal with the \\(1(1+1)\\hbar^2=2\\hbar^2\\) eigenvalues repeated three times:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommentary\n\n\n\nThe equal sign in Equation 15 and Equation 16 is not accurate, because the right hand side is the representation only on the subspace \\(\\mathcal{E}(l=1)\\), while the left hand side is the “whole operator”. What would be accurate is to use the entire basis and write:\n\\[\nJ_x =\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty\\sum_{-l\\leq m,m'\\leq l}|l,m\\rangle\\langle l,m|J_x|l,m'\\rangle\\langle l,m'|\n\\]\nrather than Equation 15.\nWe could emphasize the distinction by defining a new operator \\(J'_x\\) which is restricted to act only in this subspace:\n\\[\nJ'_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(|1,0\\rangle\\langle 1,1|+|1,1\\rangle\\langle 1,0|+|1,-1\\rangle\\langle 1,0|+|1,0\\rangle\\langle 1,-1|\\right)\n\\tag{17}\\]"

    "text": "Esta Shakti é o poder de Shiva.\nComentários:\n\nO oceano de consciência é dotado da capacidade de exercer força sobre si mesmo e de se colocar em movimento e formar ondas (i.e. objectos da consciência)\nEsta força é designada por Shakti.\nNão é uma entidade externa a colocar o oceano em movimento, é o próprio oceano que se põem a si em movimento (apenas neste caso poderíamos dizer que o oceano de consciência é tudo o que existe). Shakti não existe independentemente da consciência.\nPorque é que a palavra “Shiva” surge neste Sutram? Pois Shiva é usado [placeholder] para oceano de consciência. A razão disto jaz na seguinte imagem:\nShiva em estado de profunda meditação encontra-se imóvel, mas só até decidir abrir os olhos e começar a fazer cenas. Vemos assim que algo calmo (tal como o ocenao de consciência sem objectos da consciência) possui a capacidade de se autocolocar em movimento, é dotado de Shakti.\nprakrti = Shakti\nConceitos Filosóficos úteis:\nComo é que explico um vaso de barro? Como é que respondemos a esta pergunta? A explicação vem em dois tipos:\n\nO vaso vem da terra, que depois de lhe adicionar água é moldada pela força das mão do oleiro - Esta é a explicação material (física) é uma sequência de causa efeito. O autor do livro designa isto por Causa Material.\nO vaso existe porque quero plantar flores - Esta explicação fala do agente, que pensa e deseja. A este explicação é designada por Causa Instrumental.\nMetido nestas dois tipos de explicações de um vaso há um elemento crucial, a força das mãos do oleiro, a esta chamamos de agência conjuntiva. Sinceramente uma designação desnecessariamente complicada - designe-mo-la apenas por força.\n\nCom base nestes conceitos filosóficos, podemos dizer o oceano de consciência é simultaneamente a Causa material e intrumental dos objectos da consciência (ondas), podemos também dizer que prakti é um agente conjuntivo.\nPrakti é um vector de três componentes chamadas de gunas:\n\nSattvaguna: componente subtil (branco)\nrajoguna: componente mutativa (vermelho)\ntamoguna: componente estática (preto)\n(Não entendo esta coloração, mas presumo que a ideia é dizer que as propriedades que as componentes quantificam são análogas a propriedades que tipicamente associamos às cores. Por exemplo o vermelho é a cor que intuitivamente associamos ao perigo, e o perigo diz que se não o respeitarmos as coisas estão prestes a mudar e muito, ora esta propriedade que associamos ao vermelho é análoga à propriedade que a componente rajoguna quantifica)\n\nPrakti origina a experiência de dualidade. Exs de dualidades: noite-dia, escuro-claro, som-silêncio, mole-duro, ignorância-sabedoria. A nossa experiência do dia a dia exibe não só estes extremos, mas também também os meios termos.\nTudo o que experienciamos (macrocosmos) é shakti (prakti) temunhado pela consciencia (purusa).\nProcesso de criação (segundo AM):\n\nOceano de consciência sem ondas (estado puro), sem atributos, sem qualidades sem limites, livre, sem gunas (ok…onde está shakti…?). I.e. está além da dualidade. Este estado do oceano chamamos de nirguna (sem guna)\nAssim que prakti actua, o oceano de consciência (purusa/Shiva/brahma) ganha uma onda caracterizada pelas 3 gunas de prakti. Assim purusa adquire um novo estado a que chamamos de saguna (com guna)\nQual o historial de atributos adquiridos por estas ondas (lista de Kapil)\n\nInicialmente prakti gera o sentido de existência (fácil de ID consciência)\n…\nPrakti gera ondas que representam a matéria sólida (difícil de ID conciência)\nPurusa leva Prakti a alterar o sentido e a progressivamente acalmar o oceano\n\n\nAnandamurti diz que 1….3 temos a fase extrovertida (saincara) e fase 4. (que é 3…1) a fase introvertida (pratisaincara).\nAssim é o casamento de purusa e prakti."

    "text": "Este sutram contêm ideias já mencionadas em sutrams anteriores.\nAchei os comentários nos 2 primeiros paragrafos desnecessariamente elaboradas e em duas ocasiões até contraditórias.\nFica-se sem se saber se criação se refere ao universo físico e mental ou se a palavra criação se refere apenas à criação de uma onda.\nEm duas ocasiões o autor numa parte da frase diz que a “Consciência Nuclear…. é imutável” ou “…purusa é imóvel e imutável” mas o contexto em que estes excertos estão mergulhados sugere (em meu entender) que prakrti os transforma, donde não podem ser imutáveis.\nO autor procura também descrever uma forma simples o facto de a Consciência ser infinita e intemporal dizendo que “como não conseguimos conceber mentalmente as infinidades dizemos que”:\n\na consciência é ao mesmo tempo amarrada e não amarrada\ntemporal como intemporal\né livre mesmo quando parece pertencer à escravidão\na criação (do universo ou objectos da consciência) é eterna ou seja tem um ponto partida intemporal. A esse ponto partida chamamos kamabiija.\n\nApesar da complicação, eis a ideia central dos dois primeiros paragrafos:\nA Consciência é dotada do desejo de se expressar (icchasshakti), esse desejo desencadeia a acção da força prakti a moldar purusa.\nDe que forma é que prakrti molda purusa? Molda-a formando pensamentos (o autor introduz aqui a palavra pravrtti, onde Vrtti significa ocupação, tendência, modificação mental e pra signfica para a frente (outward flow que vimos em I.4)\nTudo isto se resuma à ideia de que o oceano de consciência ganha ondas devido à acção de prakrti tal como já tínhamos visto.\nExemplo da acção de prakrti sobre puruna.\nQuando a componente de sattvaguna da força prakrti (parte subtil) domina, o oceano calmo de consciência (purusa) adquire o conhecimento de que é consciência ou seja adquire o conhecimento de “Eu”, designamos esta aquisição por mahat ou mahatattva. Tratando-se de um objecto da consciência este é representado por uma onda. A Consciência que inicialmente era pura passou a ter uma impureza.\n\nAs três componentes de prakrti estão em constante mudança, após a componente sattvaguna ser dominante e introduzir o conceito de “Eu existo” (Aham gachhami) neste oceano de consciência, esta componente diminui ao mesmo tempo que a componente rajoguna aumenta. Ora uma força prakrti em que esta componente domina cria outra onda no oceano, que neste caso representa o conceito de “autoria”, “eu faço”. E assim o oceano passa a ter duas ondas:\nUm oceano com estas duas impurezas não pode ainda actuar pois não há (segundo o autor) nenhum objecto no oceano onde actuar. Esses objectos sobre os quais estas duas ondas actuam citta. Citta ainda não é um objecto da consciência concreto (como por exemplo a cadeira onde estou sentado), mas sim uma “onda bébé” de consciência que ainda não se formou completamente (é isto que entendi da descrição), Citta tem origem na acção da força prakrti cuja componente tamoguna é dominante. É sobre Citta que as duas ondas “Eu” e “Eu faço” actuam para (por intermédio de prakrti uma vez mais onde tamoguna domina) para fazer evoluir esta “onda bébé” para uma onda que represente um objecto concreto da consciência. Citta é também designado por matéria da mente e tem o potencial para se transformar num pensamento.\n\nO universo físico, denso, inanimado é construído pela acção de prakrti forte em tamoguna. A este processo designamos por saincara. Dito de outra forma prakrti aprisiona gradualmente purusa, resultando assim um progressiva ignorância sobre a verdadeira natureza de purusa (a este processo de aprisionamento é também designado por avidyamaya pois avidya = ignorancia) (ver fig 2 de I.4, as setas outward flow - também chamados avaranii shakti - representam este aprisionamento)\nTer na consciência os objectos mahat (“Eu sou”), aham (“Eu faço”) e citta é essencial para que se formem pensamentos, verificamos isto notando por exemplo que o nosso discurso é formado por sujeito, verbo, predicado (objecto)"

A variante desta afirmação abordada neste sutra é Se purusa e prakrti existem, então mostra-me.\nA demonstração que o autor sugere-se a apresentar em I.3, não é na realidade uma demonstração; demonstrações só existem na matemática. O que ele realmente faz é aquilo a que chamamos em inglês “inference to the best explanation”.\nEis alguns exemplos de “inference to the best explanation” apresentados pelo autor:\n\nexistência de electrões deixa vestígios, esses vestígios levam-nos a inferir que existem electrões;\nas pegadas numa floresta são também vestígios que nos levam a inferir que alguma raposa ali passou recentemente;\no LHC deixa dados, que nos levam a inferir que bosão Higgs existe.\n\nDemonstração da existência de purusa requer o seguinte lemma:\nA inteligência explica/justifica a existência da capacidade de resposta da matéria a estímulos.\nExemplo: As experiências de Bose com tecidos e metais revelaram que a resposta ao mesmo estímulo era muito semelhante (os detalhes da experiência não os sei…)\nDemonstração do lemma:\nA resposta mecânica da matéria é descrita em grande detalhe por teoria matemática, ou seja, há uma ordem que descreve tal comportamento estímulo-resposta. Essa ordem existe apenas porque existe previamente uma inteligência.\no autor não define inteligência, simplesmente dá a entender que tudo aquilo que seja capaz de reagir mecânicamente a um estimulo é dotado daquilo a que chama de inteligência, ou seja, a propriedade de inteligência é necessária à capacidade de reagir mecânicamente (ou não mecânicamente) a estímulos externos.\n\n\n\nA Demonstração: Tudo no universo (micro e macro) exibe comportamentos estimulo-resposta que são descritos por leis; incluindo as partes do universo que não entendemos (exemplo: caos). Segundo o nosso lemma, tal pressupões que existe inteligência. Como a inteligência pressupõe a existência de consciência, concluímos que consciência universal (aka purusa) existe.\nA segunda coisa que o autor pretende demonstrar é a existência de prakrti, mas falo que forma confusa, pois confunde o conceito de força que molda a consciência universal com o resultado dessa força, uma analogia ajuda a entender isto. Prakrti é como a força das mãos do oleiro e o vaso é o resultado final da acção dessa força sobre o barro (consciência). Não faz sentido usar prakrti para nos defenirmos à força e ao vaso também, mas é precisamente isto que o autor faz neste sutram. Usando esta junção de conceitos eis como o autor justifica a existência de prakrti: a realidade física é como o “vaso” e o “vaso” é prakrti.\nO autor procura tb demonstrar que purusa e prakrti são inseparáveis. Purusa é aquilo a que os físicos chamam de energia/matéria e os padrões comportamentais da energia/matéria comporta-se de forma ordenada sujeita a forças, essas forças são prakrti.\nO autor termina nas ultima duas paginas por descrever a fase evolutiva pratisaincara: a evolução progressiva desde seres vivos unicelulares até ao ser humano ocorre ao mesmo tempo que existe uma libertação progressiva de prakrti e uma revelação progressiva da consciência universal. Mesmo no estádio de ser humano, há diferentes níveis evolutivos de seres humanos, no sentido em que há diferentes níveis de revelação desta consciência universal. De forma grosseira temos:\nbacterias &lt; animais/plantas &lt; macacos &lt; ser humano lvl 1 &lt; ser humano lvl 2 &lt; … &lt; buda"

We want to describe the quantum states of its rotation motion, the appropriate Hamiltonian is thus:\n\\[\nH=\\frac{L^2}{2I}\n\\]\nwhere \\(I=\\frac{1}{2}m d^2\\) is the moment of inertia of the molecule, \\(m\\) is the nitrogen mass, \\(d\\) is the interatomic distance.\nThis Hamiltonian commutes with \\(L^2\\) and \\(L_z\\) therefore we can find a basis of eigenstates common to the three operators:\n\\[\n\\{H,L^2,L_z\\}\n\\]\nKnowing the eigenbasis common to \\(L^2\\) and \\(L_z\\) facilitates finding the eigenstates of \\(H\\) as we shall see.\nThe eigenstates of \\(L^2\\) and \\(L_z\\) are:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}&L^2\\ket{l,m}=l(l+1)\\hbar^2\\ket{l,m},\\\\&L_z\\ket{l,m}=m\\hbar\\ket{l,m}.\\end{align}\n\\tag{37}\\]\nTo find the eigenstates of \\(H\\) we start by representing \\(H\\) in this basis and then compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\nActing with \\(H\\) on the basis and using Equation 37 we find: \\(H|l,m\\rangle = \\frac{l(l+1)\\hbar^2}{2I}|l,m\\rangle\\). This is analogous to step zero from 7). Following the same steps we get the entries of the matrix:\n\\[\n\\langle l,m|H|l',m'\\rangle = \\frac{l(l+1)\\hbar^2}{2I}\\delta_{l,l'}\\delta_{m,m'}\n\\tag{38}\\]\nwhich we can use to represent the matrix:\n\nShown are the \\(l=0\\) and \\(l=1\\) subspaces representations, note the matrix is infinite!\nObserve that the matrix is diagonal and thus the eigenvectors \\(|l,m\\rangle\\) of \\(\\{L^2,L_z\\}\\) are also eigenvectors of \\(H\\)!! There is no need to diagonalize the matrix blocks.\nWe should note that the calculation of Equation 38 is essentially unnecessary since we can immediately conclude that the eigenvectors \\(|l,m\\rangle\\) common to \\(L^2\\) and \\(L_z\\) are exactly those of \\(H\\) from the fact that \\(H\\) is just \\(L^2\\) times a constant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommentary\n\n\n\nIf the matrix blocks were not diagonal we would have to diagonalize them by the usual linear algebra procedure. In such a case the triple degenerate eigenvectors of \\(\\mathcal{E}(l=1)\\) would be distinguished by a new index \\(n\\)."

    "text": "Example 2:\nConsider a spin-1/2 particle whose energy eigenstates and eigenvalues are given by \\(|n\\rangle\\) and \\(E_n=n^2 E_1\\) for \\(n=1,2,..\\)\nAssume we have a system with two of these particles, which do not interact.\n\nWrite the ground state and first excited states when the total spin is zero \\(S=0\\). What are the corresponding eigenvalues?\nWhat is the ground state when the total spin is \\(1\\)?\n\nAnswer:\nThe single particle states are of the form \\(|\\text{spacial}\\rangle \\otimes|\\text{spin}\\rangle\\) where\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&|\\text{spacial}\\rangle \\in \\text{span}\\{\\text{Eigenstates of $h$ }\\}\\\\\n&|\\text{spin}\\rangle \\in \\text{span}\\{\\text{Eigenstates of $S^2$ and $S_z$}\\}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nMore concretely we have \\(|n\\rangle\\otimes |m\\rangle\\) with \\(n=1,2,..\\) and \\(m=\\pm1/2\\); usually written as \\(|n,m\\rangle\\).\nWhy are the single particle eigenstates of this form? Answer: The observables \\(\\{h,S^2,S_z\\}\\) commutes (common eigenvectors exists) and the operators are independent (\\(h\\) is not a function of either \\(S^2\\) or \\(S_z\\)) and thus it suffices to specify the quantum numbers of each operator (the quantum number \\(s=1/2\\) is suppressed in the notation)\nThe possible quantum states of the total system are the eigenstates of the observables \\(\\{H,S_1^2,S_{1z}, S_2^2,S_{2z} \\}\\) with the total Hamiltonian as \\(H = h_1 +h_2+V_{12}\\) where \\(V_{12}\\) is zero since we are assuming non-interaction particles. We should look at these operators as extensions, for example the Hamiltonian is:\n\\[\nh_1 \\otimes 1_2 \\otimes 1_{s1} \\otimes 1_{s2}+ 1_1 \\otimes h_2 \\otimes 1_{s1} \\otimes 1_{s2}\n\\]\nwith\n\\[ h_i|i:n_i\\rangle =n_i^2E_1|i:n_i\\rangle \\]\nThe eigenstates of the system are of the form:\n\\[\n|1:n_1,m_1\\rangle \\otimes |2:n_2,m_2\\rangle\n\\]\nwhich can be written more compactly as:\n\\[\n|n_1,n_2\\rangle \\otimes |m_1,m_2\\rangle\n\\]\nHence for \\(i=1,2\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&H|n_1,n_2\\rangle \\otimes |m_1,m_2\\rangle = \\frac{n_1^2+n_2^2}{2I}E_1|n_1,n_2\\rangle \\otimes |m_1,m_2\\rangle\\\\\n&S^2_i|n_1,n_2\\rangle \\otimes |m_1,m_2\\rangle = \\frac{3\\hbar^2}{4}|n_1,n_2\\rangle \\otimes |m_1,m_2\\rangle\\\\\n&S_{iz}|n_1,n_2\\rangle \\otimes |m_1,m_2\\rangle = m_i\\hbar |n_1,n_2\\rangle \\otimes |m_1,m_2\\rangle\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe two question posed refer to the total spin of the system, so it is a good idea to change the spin basis and write the spin part involving the total spin. We know from the previous theory that:\n\\[\n\\text{span}\\{|n_1,n_2\\rangle \\otimes |m_1,m_2\\rangle\\} = \\text{span}\\{|n_1,n_2\\rangle \\otimes |S,M\\rangle\\}\n\\]\nWhere again we suppress from the spin part this: \\(|\\overbrace{1/2,1/2},S,M\\rangle\\)\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&H|n_1,n_2\\rangle \\otimes |S,M\\rangle = \\frac{n_1^2+n_2^2}{2I}E_1|n_1,n_2\\rangle \\otimes |S,M\\rangle\\\\\n&S^2_i|n_1,n_2\\rangle \\otimes |S,M\\rangle = \\frac{3\\hbar^2}{4}|n_1,n_2\\rangle \\otimes |S,M\\rangle\\\\\n&S^2|n_1,n_2\\rangle \\otimes |S,M\\rangle = S(S+1)\\hbar^2|n_1,n_2\\rangle \\otimes |S,M\\rangle\\\\\n&S_{z}|n_1,n_2\\rangle \\otimes |S,M\\rangle = M\\hbar |n_1,n_2\\rangle \\otimes |S,M\\rangle\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nWe want the states of the form \\(|n_1,n_2\\rangle \\otimes |S,M\\rangle\\) such that the following statements are true:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nP_{21}|n_1,n_2\\rangle \\otimes |S,M\\rangle =-1\\times|n_1,n_2\\rangle \\otimes |S,M\\rangle\\\\\n|S,M\\rangle = |S=0,M=0\\rangle\\\\\n\\frac{n_1^2+n_2^2}{2I}E_1\\quad \\text{is minimum}\n\\end{cases}\n\\] Since the spin part is antissimetric:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nP_{21} |0,0\\rangle &= P_{21} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|1:\\uparrow,2:\\downarrow\\rangle - |1:\\downarrow,2:\\uparrow\\rangle ) \\\\\n&= -1\\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|1:\\uparrow,2:\\downarrow\\rangle - |1:\\downarrow,2:\\uparrow\\rangle )\\\\\n&-1\\times |0,0\\rangle\n\\end{align}\n\\] we seek a spacial ket that is symmetric and whose energy is minimum.\nThe spacial state \\(n_1=n_2=1\\) statisfies the criteria. Therefore the final answer is:\n\\[\n|1,1\\rangle\\otimes|0,0\\rangle\n\\]\nor\n\\[\n|1,1\\rangle \\otimes \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|1:\\uparrow,2:\\downarrow\\rangle - |1:\\downarrow,2:\\uparrow\\rangle )\n\\]\nwhose eigenvalue is \\((1^2 + 1^2) E_1\\).\nFollowing a similar line of reasoning the first excited state with \\(S=0\\) must be:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|2,1\\rangle + |1,2\\rangle) \\otimes |0,0\\rangle\n\\]\nObserve that the spacial spate is symmetric when we use the \\(+\\) sign!\nWhen \\(S=1\\) the spin state is one of the symetric triplet states:\n$$\n\\[\\begin{align}\n&\\ket{1,1}=\\ket{1/2,1/2}\\\\\n&\\ket{1,0}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}+\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)\\\\\n&\\ket{1,-1}=\\ket{-1/2,-1/2}\n\\end{align}\\] $$\nAs a result the spacial part must be antissymetric for the whole quantum state of the two particles to be antissymetric as PEP requires. Thus:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|2,1\\rangle - |1,2\\rangle)\\otimes |1,1\\rangle\\\\\n&\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|2,1\\rangle - |1,2\\rangle)\\otimes |1,0\\rangle\\\\\n&\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|2,1\\rangle - |1,2\\rangle)\\otimes |1,-1\\rangle\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNotice the minimum energy AND antissymetry of the spacial part only occurs at the FIRST excited state. The spacial ground state is the symmetric \\(|1,1\\rangle\\)."

Estes processos são também designados por objectos da consciência.\n\nRelação: consciência é necessária aos processos dinâmicos.\nEsta relação sugere que [experiênciar um processo dinâmico] é um novo estado de consciência, para entender o quero dizer por estado usemos a seguinte analogia: cada onda é um novo estado de um oceano originalmente calmo (o estado original = calmo, estado final= ondular). Assim os nossos pensamentos, emoções e o que recolhemos dos sentidos existe dentro de um campo de consciência (=cognição) e são novos estados de consciência.\nBrahma = conjunto das consciências de todos nós (o que inclui - por definição de consciência - todos objectos da consciência)\nShakti = força que altera o estado calmo do “oceano” de consciência para o estado de “ondas” (objectos da consciência)\npensamento e consciência são coisas distintas, um pensamento é um exemplo de um objecto da consciência, uma onda, e que portanto evolui no tempo.\nMaterialismo = sistema pensamento (filosófico) que têm como suposição - a matéria é primordial. Tudo o que experenciamos pelos sentidos, a consciência, o pensamento, as emoções etc emergem da matéria. Por exemplo, quando vejo uma rosa, essa experiência emerge do funcionamento do cérebro (matéria). Se o cérebro não existir ou estiver lesionado podemos não ver a cor da rosa ou mesmo a rosa. Donde podemos dizer que o funcionamento do cérebro é necessário à experiência da rosa.\nMas será o cérebro necessário à consciência ou será a consciência necessária ao cérebro?\nO autor parece sugerir que a última é que está correcta pois a actividade cerebral não passa de algo que observamos e medimos e portanto trata-se de mais um objecto da consciência (processo dinâmico). Conclui-se daqui que a consciência é primordial (segundo o autor)\natman (alma) = consciência, “eu sou” puro\nSadhana: Toda as definições e ideias acima tornam-se mais claras pela experiência. Observa os teus pensamentos ao longo do dia, eventualmente tornar-se-á claro que a sua dinâmica temporal é observada constantemente pela consciência, esta sim invariante no tempo. A meditação deverá ajudar nesta experiência, pois ao acalmar a dinâmica do oceano, torna-se mais evidente quando é que este deixa de ser calmo."

    "text": "A consciência suprema, purusottama, é o núcleo do universo.\nComentários:\n\nTudo no universo (incluindo a nossa mente) pode ser descrito por sistemas e subsistemas. Para identificar um sistema temos de identificar uma fronteira, física ou conceptual, que separa o sistema, de tudo o resto (que em si é outro sistema).\nAo conjunto de sistemas e das leis que os descrevem é aquilo a que autor chama de estrutura do universo (ou da natureza).\nSuposição: Um sistema (físico ou conceptual) apresenta sempre um núcleo.\nSuposição: o universo tem origem inteligente.\nIsto tem um implicação muito importante, pois se é inteligente, é que esperar que exista uma estrutura sob todo o universo.\nSuposição: O universo - oceano com ondas - evolui ao longo do tempo devido à força Chakti. O estado dessas ondas reflecte as características da força que as originou, essas características são três, as três gunas. Cada onda reflecte assim uma certa combinação de três gunas. Portanto, cada onda é distinguível das demais e dizemos por isso que existe um principio de dualidade, entenda-se, um principio de que os objectos da consciências (ondas) são distinguíveis. O autor refere-se que há uma “Lei de Dualidade” a actuar sobre o universo (criação), o que se entende por isto é que existe um força (chakti) que consegue formar ondas (conceptuais ou físicas) que nós conseguimos distinguir.\nSuposição: A nossa mente apenas consegue entender as partes do universo (conceptual ou físico) que têm estrutura, i.e., que resultam da actuação da Lei de Dualidade. Mais ainda, também apenas entendemos as partes que têm um centro.\nO que é esta ideia de centro?\nA seguinte figura dá-nos a ideia:\n\nUm sistema de conceitos ou físico tem sempre uma estrutura que se assemelha a esta figura. Os pontos representam ideias ou sistemas físicos, enquanto os ramos representam uma certa relação entre ambos.\nExemplos:\n\nO centro de uma história é o moral da história.\nA terra gira em torno do sol, o centro é o sol.\nA família é o centro das nossas relações sociais.\nOs pensamentos e emoções que temos têm uma estrutura centrada na nossa memória (karma), o seu centro.\numa pintura (quadro) tem o seu centro também, que tanto pode ser explicito ou implicito (conceptual)\n\nTodos os sistemas que conseguimos identificar fazem parte de um Mega Sistema a que chamamos de:\n\nsistema supremo\nsistema cosmológico\nbrahmacakra (AM)\n\nA evolução temporal do sistema cosmológico é de tal forma que satisfaz uma alternância (ciclica) entre saincara e pratisaincara.\nO ponto fixo da dinâmica do sistema é o mar de consciência testemunhal a que o autor chama também paramashiva, purusottama, consciência nuclear.\nO autor refere também que o universo físico não tem centro físico, mas tem um centro conceptual, que é o individuo (jiivatma). Esta ideia é um pouco confusa porque o individuo, que entendo como sendo o corpo físico, muda no tempo e portanto não está fixo.\nO autor introduz vários tipos de consciência, que na verdade são apenas rótulos úteis para distinguir diferentes pontos vista sobre a Consciência (aka oceano de Consciência) que é único. Assim no texto encontramos:\n\nconsciência refere-se à definição intuitiva de consciência (não a um oceano).\nConsciência testemunhal é imutável e “observa” os objectos da consciência. É também designada por paramashiva ou purusottama\nConsciência nuclear refere-se à parte do oceano que é imutável. Por isso esta designação é equivalente à Consciência testemunhal.\nConsciência Suprema é equivalente a Consciência, o que por sua vez se refere à [Consciência testemunhal] + [objectos da consciência].\nobjectos da consciência são a parte mutável da Consciência (as ondas).\n\nSaincara pode ser visto como outward flow e pratisaincara como inward flow dos objectos da consciência em direcção ao núcleo de consciência tal como vemos na figura:"

    "text": "Example 3: \\(1001/12\\) using elementary school’s long division\nTo complement and expand on the previous example, let us consider now a more sophisticated division \\(1001/12\\), how do we argue as in elementary school?\nWe observe the number \\(1001\\) we lump digits from left to right and ask whether the lumped is larger (and thus divisible) than \\(12\\):\n\nThe first lump is just the digit \\(1\\) on the left in \\(1001\\), it is smaller than \\(12\\) and thus not divisible.\nWhat does this line of reasoning means? Focusing on the first digit and checking whether it is divisible by \\(12\\) is equivalent to decompose \\(1001\\) as \\(1001 = 1\\cdot 10^3 +1\\) and trying to guess what \\(q\\) that makes \\(q\\cdot 12\\) best cover the \\(1\\cdot 10^3\\) on the lhs of:\n\\[\n1\\cdot 10^3 +1 = q\\cdot 12+r\n\\]\nInstead of trying to solve this problem the elementary school algorithm, tell us, instead, to lumps the first two digits of \\(1001\\), and try again: [Is \\(10\\) divisible by \\(12\\)?].\nThe second lump is \\(10\\). Once again we see \\(10\\) is not divisible by \\(12\\) seince \\(10&lt;12\\).\nWhat does this line of reasoning mean? Lumping the first two digits on the left trying to divide by \\(12\\) is equivalento to trying to solve the equation:\n\\[\n10\\cdot 10^2 +1 = q\\cdot 12+r\n\\]\nNotice that we could do it, a good guess would be \\(q=10^2\\) again, but we do not follow this path, as stated by the elementary’s school algorithm we should instead lump the three digits on the left and try again by asking [Is \\(100\\) divisible by \\(12\\)?].\nThe third lump is \\(100\\). Yes! Since \\(100&gt;12\\), we finally have a lump which we can divide by \\(12\\). How many times \\(12\\) fits in \\(100\\)? After some thought and side calculations we arrive at the answer \\(8\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does this line of reasoning mean?

In case the \\(8\\cdot 10\\) guess is not clear, note that \\(12\\) fits \\(8\\) times in \\(100\\), but since what we actually have is \\(100\\cdot 10\\) we have to multiply the \\(8\\) by \\(10\\) giving us the \\(q=8\\cdot 10\\). The fact that \\(8\\) comes multiplied by \\(10\\) is the reason why we put in the ten’s place (under the \\(1\\) in \\(12\\)):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next step in ESA is to multiply \\(8\\times 12 = 96\\) and place it under the ten’s place of \\(1001\\),\nWhat does this step mean? Because, \\(8\\) is under the ten’s place, we should see it as \\(8\\cdot 10\\) and not just an \\(8\\), thus this step is doing the calculation \\(8\\times 10 \\times 12 =960\\), rewriting the \\(960\\) as a \\(96\\cdot 10\\) tell us we should put a \\(96\\) in the ten’s place under the \\(1001\\) .\n\n\n\n\n\nNext in ESA is to compute the difference \\(100-96=4\\) and then drop the rightmost \\(1\\) in \\(1001\\):\nWhat does this step mean?\nThis step is the computation of the remainder of Equation 10 for our first guess \\(q=8\\cdot 10\\):\n\\[ \\begin{align} &100\\times 10 +1 = 8\\cdot 10\\cdot 12 +r\\\\ \\implies &r= (100-96)\\times 10+1\\\\\n\\implies & r=4\\times 10 +1 \\end{align}  \\tag{11}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the remainder \\(r=41\\) does not satisfy \\(0\\leq r&lt;12\\), is not the smallest it can be, i.e., \\(12\\) still fits in it a few number of times, the ESA does not stop here - inside the problem we are attempting to solve \\(1001/12\\) we found a sub-problem, which is now to divide \\(41\\) by \\(12\\). How many times is \\(12\\) in \\(41\\)?\nJust like we lumped digits from the left in \\(1001\\) and did check whether they are or not divisible by \\(12\\), we now do the same with \\(41\\): The first lump is just \\(4\\), which is not divisible by \\(12\\), so we lump the first two digits giving us \\(41\\). Trial and error and guess-work tell us that \\(12\\) fits \\(3\\) times in \\(41\\), we place it under the one’s place (under the \\(2\\) in \\(12\\)):\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does this step means? The sub-problem we are trying to solve is: find \\(q'\\) and \\(r'\\) such that:\n\\[\n41 = q'\\cdot 12 +r'\n\\]\nBy simple guess-work, \\(q'=3\\) is a good answer because it guarantees \\(q'\\cdot 12\\) is the largest number below \\(41\\). Note this \\(3\\) from our guess is \\(3\\times 1\\) (and not \\(3\\cdot 10\\)), thus we place it under the one’s place of \\(12\\).\nThe next step in ESA is to multiply \\(3\\times 12\\) to obtain \\(36\\), we write it under the \\(1\\)’s place of \\(41\\):\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving from the current remainder \\(41\\) this \\(36\\) gives:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does this step mean? Using equation notation the problem being solved is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&41 = 3\\cdot 12 +r'\\\\\n\\implies &r' = 41-36 =5\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{12}\\]\nCombining our results Equation 11 and Equation 12 we conclude:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n1001 = 8\\times 10\\times 12 + 41\\\\\n41 = 3\\cdot 12 +5\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Example."

If \\(N_1\\) particles where send one by one (or at once) toward \\(N_2\\) particles, the \\(A_1\\) particle would see a density \\(n_2\\).\n\nand for each \\(A_1\\) incoming we would have a Bernoulli trial with probability: \\[p(\\text{hit one $A_2$})=\\frac{N_2 \\sigma}{A}=n_2\\sigma\\]Note that the cross section \\(\\sigma\\) describes only whether a particle \\(A_2\\) is hit or not, and does not care about the direction of the scattered \\(A_1\\). Later we’ll define a new quantity the scattering cross section which also takes into account this direction.\nAs a result we have the Binomial probability law on the random variable \\(X=[x \\,\\,\\text{particles hit}]\\): \\[P(X=x)=\\binom{N_1}{x}p^x(1-p)^{N_1-x} \\] The expected value of this r.v. is: \\[E[X]=N_1 p = N_1 n_2 \\sigma\\] which we rename as \\(N_{sc}\\) just as Taylor does in formula (14.2) of Chap. 14, also we rename \\(N_{inc}:=N_1\\), \\(n_{tar} :=n_2\\):\n\\[\nN_{sc}= N_{inc}n_{tar} \\sigma\n\\tag{13}\\]\nA schematic situation is shown in the following picture\n\nThis diagram is a sequence of \\(N\\) Bernoulli trials which are in turn characterized by the parameter \\(p\\), to the attached the Binomial probability law. Mathematically the diagram shows a sequence of trials which can succeed or not. Physically each trial can be interpreted as we want, the probability law is the same formula. For example, each branch can be seen as a trial for hit or miss of \\(N=3\\) incoming particles toward a uniformly distributed set of target particles which yield a probability of hit given by \\(n_2\\sigma\\). Another example is consider just one incoming particle toward the targets and each trial describes an encounter which can result in a hit or miss. Either way the Bernoulli formula remains exactly the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommentary\n\n\n\nThe two examples focus on a vertical and horizontal slices of an ensemble. In the horizontal slice view, we have one incoming particle and \\(N_1\\) trials (for \\(t\\) seconds) with probability of hit given by \\(p\\). In this case \\(P(X=x)\\) should be interpreted as the probability of the same molecule collide \\(x\\) times in \\(N\\) trials. In particular \\(P(X=1)\\) is the probability that one particle collides just once in \\(N_1\\) trials. \\(P(X=1)\\) does NOT mean the probability that one particle survives \\(N_1-1\\) times and then collides at the \\(N_1\\) trial, this probability would be given by \\(p(1-p)^{N_1-1}\\) just as written in p. 466 of Reif."

    "text": "Using Poisson distribution to describe collisions\nIf we assume we send each one of \\(N_1\\) particles each \\(dt\\) seconds (i.e. this is just a way to guarantee each incoming particle does not interact with each other) and make \\(N_1\\) larger and larger while \\(p\\) is fixed, the Bernoulli distribution formula is the same as above, but the expected value gets also larger and larger; this is one way to compute the limit distribution, lets see another, more useful one. Take the limit of \\(N_1\\) while keeping the average value constant instead. Pictorially we have:\n\n\n\nA particle is sent each dt seconds, either it hits or misses the array of targets. In t seconds it is sent N=infinity particles.\n\n\nDefine now the r.v. \\(X=x \\,\\,\\text{particles hit in $t$ seconds}\\), then using the Binomial prob law we find: \\[P(X=x)=\\binom{N_1}{x}p^x\\left(1-p\\right)^{N_1-x}\\] The expected value is \\(E[X]= p N_1\\). We would like to take now \\(N_1\\rightarrow \\infty\\), but this entails the expected value to go to infinity if we assume \\(p\\) constant. For the present scenario a better model is to assume the expected value is constant, i.e., we expect in any \\(t\\) seconds to find on average the same number of hits. To fix the expected value lets rename it as the product \\(w t\\). Hence let us introduce the quantity \\(w\\) such that: \\[w t\\coloneqq N_1 p =N_1 dt\\, w\\] As a consequence of fixing the average value though the fix of \\(w\\) we find as a side effect: \\[p(\\text{hit between $t$ and $t+dt$})\\coloneqq w dt =\\frac{n_2\\sigma}{t}dt\\] We see now that \\(w\\) is the probability of hit per unit time. And \\(dt=t/N_1\\). As a result the probability law is given by \\[P(X=x)=\\binom{N_1}{x}\\left(\\frac{w t}{N_1}\\right)^x\\left(1-\\frac{w t}{N_1}\\right)^{N_1-x}\\] The expected value is fix at \\(E[X]= p N_1=w t\\) in this limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommentary\n\n\n\n_We need not define the expected value as \\(wt\\), we could have just defined instead \\(E[X]\\coloneqq \\lambda\\) and fix \\(\\lambda\\), this is done in Sec. 3.8 of Wackerly. Setting it to \\(wt\\) was just a psychologically convenient way to make the parameter \\(t\\) appear in the equation. Note the Poisson distribution depends on \\(wt\\) and not on \\(t\\) or \\(w\\) alone.\n\n\nHaving established all parameters and their dependencies and what is constant, we only have one independent variable in the probability law. Taking the limit as \\(N_1\\) goes to infinity we arrive at: \\[P(X=x)=\\frac{(w t)^x}{x!}e^{-w t}\\] Which is the Poisson distribution. But what does it mean? Going back to the diagram above, we have an infinite number of trials between \\(0\\) and \\(t\\) seconds with a small probability \\(p\\), we can interpret them by imagining a set of infinite particles incoming to an uniformly distributed set of target particles each branch the correspond to the trial of a given particle; note how this interpretation is not good, because we would guess that the probability for each hit or miss is finite and not the small number \\(n_2\\sigma dt/t\\). Let us consider a second interpretation, one particle incoming toward the targets and at each trial (which occurs in \\(dt\\) seconds) decides whether it hit or miss, with probability that must ensure the macroscopic observed value of \\(wt\\) hits in \\(t\\) seconds. Under this last interpretation, \\(P(X=0)\\) is \\(e^{-w t}\\) is the probability of that particle suffering no collisions in \\(t\\) seconds at the collision rate \\(w\\). \\(P(X=1)=wt e^{-w t}\\) is the probability that the one incoming particle to collide once in \\(t\\) seconds, but it takes into account, see \\(wt\\) (represented by the binomial coefficient in Bernoulli) the fact that the collision can occur at any time during those \\(t\\) seconds.\nNotice that \\(P(X=1)\\) does NOT mean it survives every trial between \\(0\\) and \\(t\\) and then collides. That quantity is computed in p. 466 and 467 of Reif. and here is the gist of it, fixing the particular branch described by \\[\\overbrace{tt\\dots tth}^N\\]where t=miss and h= hit. We know that it has probability \\((1-p)^{N-1}p\\) of occurring (it is the [[Bernoulli process#^b9ae87|Geometric distribution]]), we are not interested in any other sequence of hits and misses other than \\(tt \\dots h\\), hence we did not take into account the \\(\\binom{N}{1}\\) factor, substituting \\(p=w\\,dt\\): \\[P(\\text{survives for $N-1$ trials and then hit})=\\left(1-w\\,dt\\right)^{N-1}w\\, dt=\\left(1-\\frac{wt}{N}\\right)^{N-1}w \\frac{t}{N}\\] this probability law (for this fixed branch) only depends on \\(t\\) and \\(N\\), but taking the limit of \\(N\\longrightarrow \\infty\\) while \\(w\\) is constant we get \\[P(\\text{survives for $t$ seconds and then hit})=e^{-wt}w\\,dt\\] which depends only on \\(t\\); this is the [[Bernoulli Process vs Poisson Process|Exponential Distribution]] its the one derived by Reif. in Sec. 12.1. The expected value of r.v. \\(t\\) is: \\[E[t]=\\int_0^\\infty dt\\,e^{wt}w t=\\frac{1}{w}\\] which is also the characteristic decay of the probability law."

If we assume there is no external forces acting on the particles the center of mass position moves at constant velocity and therefore constitute a inertial reference frame \\(\\mathcal{O}_{cm}\\). This is the first point of view we’ll adopt. The second point of view is a special case of a lab reference frame - the conventional lab frame for collisions - it is set in such a way that particle \\(2\\), the target is initially at rest. I would like to emphasize the key word initially at rest, that means that in the reference frame, after the collision, the particle \\(2\\) is no longer at rest.\nSee Fig. 14.14 Taylor\n\nIn \\(\\mathcal{O}_{cm}\\) the initial and final momenta of both particles is given by Equation 6\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{p}_{1,cm} = -\\mathbf{p}_{2,cm} \\equiv \\mathbf{p}_{cm}= \\mu \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}\\\\\n\\mathbf{p}_{1,cm}' = -\\mathbf{p}_{2,cm}' \\equiv \\mathbf{p}_{cm}'=\\mu \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}'\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{8}\\]\nIn \\(\\mathcal{O}_{lab}\\) we find\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\mathbf{p}_{1,lab} =\\lambda \\mathbf{p}+\\mathbf{p}\\\\\n&\\mathbf{p}_{1,lab}' = \\lambda \\mathbf{p}+\\mathbf{p}'\\qquad \\lambda =\\frac{m_1}{m_2}\\\\\n&\\mathbf{p}_{2,lab}=\\mathbf{p}'_{2,lab}=\\mathbf{0}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nproof: In this reference frame, \\(\\mathbf{p}_{1,lab} =m_1 \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_1\\) which when written in generalized coordinates of center of mass plus relative distance become:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{p}_{1,lab} &=m_1 \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_1\\\\\n&=m_1(\\dot{\\mathbf{R}}+\\frac{m_2}{M}\\dot{\\mathbf{r}})\\\\\n&=m_1\\dot{\\mathbf{R}}+\\mu\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{9}\\]\n\nNow, for particle \\(2\\) we also write \\(\\mathbf{p}_{2,lab} =m_2 \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_2\\), but since this particle is at rest in the lab frame we have \\(\\mathbf{p}_{2,lab}=\\mathbf{0}\\). Additionally, from the definition of center of mass Equation 1 we simplify Equation 9 using the observation that:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dot{\\mathbf{R}} = \\frac{m_1}{M}\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_1=\\frac{m_1}{M}\\dot{\\mathbf{r}} =\\frac{\\mu}{m_2}\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}=\\frac{\\mathbf{p}}{m_2}\\\\\n\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r}_2 = \\mathbf{r}_1\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{10}\\]\nwhere at the last step we used Equation 8; the momentum \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) is of a fictitious particle with mass \\(\\mu\\).

The first of which is: Computing \\((x^3+1)/(x+2)\\) is equivalent to solving the equation\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\nx^3+1 = q(x)(x+2) +r(x)\n\\end{equation}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nfor \\(q(x)\\) and \\(r(x)\\). To see the equivalence between these two problems more clearly, just rearrange Equation 2 into:\n\\[\n\\frac{x^3+1}{x+2} = q(x) +\\frac{r(x)}{x+2}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nWhat do we see now? On the left hand side, the polynomial we want to compute, on the right hand side of the equation we see \\(q(x)\\), the quotient, a polynomial we think \\((x^3+1)/(x+2)\\) represents, but! Since in many examples this representation is not exact (as we shall see) we need to add to it a final correction \\(r(x)/(x+2)\\) to make the equality between the sides, exact. Equation 2 is the one line version of the quotient operation we traditionally think as Equation 3 .\nWhat is this \\(r(x)\\)? To answer just observe Equation 2, note that the polynomial \\(p(x)=x^3+1\\) is split into a sum of two special polynomials: one of them is fully divisible by \\(d(x)\\) which is the polynomial \\(q(x)(x+2)\\), while the other is not, it is called the remainder \\(r(x)\\), because it represents the part of \\(x^3+1\\) which was not fully divisible by \\(x+2\\), and thus remains to be divisible, the following picture shows the key parts of Equation 3 :\n\nAll this will become clear when we see examples, for now lets just write what is \\(q(x)\\) and \\(r(x)\\) for the divisions in Equation 1 :\n\nthe oneline-quotient formula that relates \\(x^3+1\\) and \\(x+2\\) is \\(x^3+1 = (x^2-2x+4)(x+2)-7\\). Here \\(q(x)\\) is \\(x^2-2x+4\\) which when multiplied by \\(d(x)=x+2\\) does not gives us exactly the original \\(p(x)=x^3+1\\), almost! After adding the correction \\(r(x)=-7\\), the equality is restored; \\(-7\\) is the part inside \\(p(x)\\) which was not divisible by \\(x+2\\), so it appear as the remainder - what remains of \\(p(x)\\) to be divisible.\nthe equation that relates \\(x^3+1\\) and \\(x+1\\) is \\(x^3+1 = (x^2-x+1)(x+1)\\). This time the remainder is zero, \\(r(x)=0\\), the polynomial \\(p(x)=x^3+1\\) is fully divisible by \\(d(x)=x+1\\), not a part of it remains indivisible by \\(x+1\\), so no correction is need.\n\nThe algorithm to compute the division of polynomials is a sequence of steps we can follow to find \\(q(x)\\) and \\(r(x)\\) from the given \\(p(x)\\) and \\(d(x)\\), this algorithm is analogous to the algorithm of long division of integers learned in elementary school. We shall start by recalling the basic ideas behind long division of integer and then use them later in the division of polynomials."

We would have to guess just glancing Equation 12 that \\(q=83\\) and \\(r=5\\). That is hard or you are luck.\nLets decompose \\(1001\\) into powers of \\(10\\) to aid our guesses (other decomposition are possible, we seen another in the elementary school’s approach; the powers of \\(10\\) is the basic one because it is exactly what the symbol \\(1001\\) means)\n\\[\n1001 = 1\\cdot 10^3+0\\cdot 10^2 +0\\cdot 10^1+1\\cdot 10^0 = 1\\cdot 10^3 +1\\cdot 10^0\n\\]\nNoting \\(12=10+2\\), lets guess the solution for:\n\\[\n1\\cdot 10^3 +1 = q\\cdot(10+2)+r\n\\]\nGuess: \\(q=8\\cdot 10\\) guarantees that \\(q\\cdot 10\\) is close to \\(1\\cdot 10^3\\) (notice \\(8\\) is almost \\(10\\))\nSubstitution gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&1\\cdot 10^3 +1 = 8\\cdot 10^2 +16 \\cdot 10 + r\\\\\n\\implies&1\\cdot 10^3 +1 = 9\\cdot10^2+6\\cdot10+r\\\\\n\\implies & r=1\\cdot 10^2-6\\cdot 10+1 \\\\\n\\implies&r=4\\cdot10+1\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{13}\\]\nThe remainder is positive and larger than the divisor \\(12\\) so we keep going.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommentary\n\n\n\nNote that a guesses \\(q=9\\cdot 10\\) or \\(q=10^2\\) would lead to a negative remainders.

Figuring out the original zero (the zero of \\(f\\)) is the hardest part, a graph might help in our guess work, if nothing else, just use trial and error. If it is found, congrate yourself, you just made one step of \\(n\\) steps.\n\nWhy factoring polynomials is cool?\nOne key aspect one should keep in mind, is that finding the zeros of a polynomial and factored polynomial goes hand in hand. As we seen, the zeros of \\(x4-x3-3x^2+5x-2\\) are singlet \\(-2\\), and a triplet \\(1\\), but knowing allowed us to write this polynomial as \\((x+2)(x-1)^3\\). Going the other way around, starting from a polynomial given by \\((x+2)(x-1)^3\\) we know,just by looking at this formula, the zeros are \\(-2\\) and a triplet \\(1\\). Knowing the zeros is important or should I say knowing the factored form of a polynomial is important because, in-between those zeros, the polynomial must either positive (above the x-axis) or negative (below the x-axis). Additionally,note that the factored form of a polynomial is a product of simple polynomials, in the current case it the product of four terms of degree one, \\(x+2\\) and three \\(x-1\\); the sign (positive or negative) of each is easily computed, this are just lines in the plane! As a result the sign of the product polynomial can also be easily computed from the sign of the a product of the terms. It goes without saying: The good polynomial is the factored polynomial.\nWhat we intend to do now is precisely to find the sign (positive or negative) of the product polynomial in-between the zeros (\\(-2\\) and \\(1\\)) we found, in other words we want to compute the following sets:\n\\[ \\begin{align} \\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\,\\,|\\,\\,x^4-x^3-3x^2+5x-1&gt;0\\}\\\\ \\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\,\\,|\\,\\,x^4-x^3-3x^2+5x-1&lt;0\\} \\end{align}  \\tag{17}\\] start by computing the sign of the four terms and then compute the sign of their product. Here’s an example:\nWe already know the zeros of \\(x ^ 4-x ^ 3-3x^2+5x-1\\) which are embeeded in the terms\n\n\\(x+2\\) is zero at \\(x=-2\\)\n\\(x-1\\) which apeears three times has a zero ar \\(x=1\\)\n\nNow, to compute the sign of the term, draw a table as follows: in the first column put the factors, the first row is suppose to represent the real line, in it we highlight key points, which in the present case are the zeros of the factors, the point at \\(-2\\) and \\(1\\) , and as reference we should include the infinities aswell:\n\n\n\nReal line\n\\(-\\infty\\)\n\n\\(-2\\)\n\n\\(1\\)\n\n\\(\\infty\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(x+2\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\n\n\\(x-1\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\n\n\\(x-1\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\n\n\\(x-1\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\n\n\\((x+2)(x-1)^3\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\n\n\n\nIn the he \\(x+2\\) and \\(x-1\\) fill the zeros as \\(x=-2\\) and \\(x=1\\) respectively. Now, take the \\(x+2\\) row as an example, there is only one zero, hence before that zero we have a definite sign and after this zero we have a definite sign, to find these sign we can just pick any two \\(x\\)-values, picking \\(x=-3\\) and \\(x=1\\) we compute \\(-3+2 = -1\\) which is negative and thus the region \\((-\\infty,-2)\\) must be negative; computing \\(1+2=3\\) we get a positive value, thus the region \\((-2,\\infty)\\) is positive. We repeat the same approach and pick two numbers, one before and other after \\(x=1\\) the zero of \\(x-1\\) to check its sign, the results are shown above\nThe last row is also easy to fill from the signs of \\(x+2\\) and \\((x-1)^3\\), notice the cube power, being an odd number, does not change the sign of \\(x-1\\).\nFrom the last row we can read the answer for out quesion ?@eq-set_in_question , we conclude:\n\\[ \\begin{align} &\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\,\\,|\\,\\,x^4-x^3-3x^2+5x-1&gt;0\\}=(-\\infty,-2)\\cup (1,+\\infty)\\\\ &\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\,\\,|\\,\\,x^4-x^3-3x^2+5x-1&lt;0\\}=(-2,1) \\end{align} \\] The table method to find the signs of a complicated polynomial is fine and good, but I would like to emphasize the central idea behind it. What the table essentially is, is a representation of the graph of the factors with just the signs singled out. As such an alternative way, which I actually prefer, to find the answer to Equation 17 is to just graph the terms of the product polynomial:\n\nAnd from it read the signs from the lines:\n\nif in turn we know a zero of \\(q\\) then again, division of \\(q(x)\\) by \\(x-\\text{zero of $q$}\\) yields again a zero remainder:\n\nTherefore:\n\nAnd the same story continues with \\(q'\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommentary\n\n\n\nNotice that a zero of \\(q\\) is automatically a zero of \\(f\\). And a zero of \\(q'\\) is a zero of \\(f\\) as well.\n\n\nHere is a more elaborate example of this:\n\\[\nf(x) = x^4 -x^3-3x^2+5x-2\n\\]\nhas a zero at \\(x=1\\), using polynomial division we find:\n\\[\n\\overbrace{x^4 -x^3-3x^2+5x-2}^f = \\overbrace{(x^3-3x+2)}^q(x-1)+\\overbrace{0}^r\n\\]\nBut inspection of \\(q\\) reveals that \\(q(1)=0\\), using polynomial division we find:\n\\[\n\\overbrace{x^3-3x+2}^q = \\overbrace{(x^2+x-2)}^{q'}(x-1)+\\overbrace{0}^{r'}\n\\]\nNow inspect \\(x^2+x-2\\), what do we find? We find that \\(q'(1)=0\\), using again polynomial division:\n\\[\n\\overbrace{x^2+x-2}^{q'} =\\overbrace{(x+2)}^{q''}(x-1)+\\overbrace{0}^{r''}\n\\]\nCollecting terms we find a complete decomposition of our original polynomial into a product of simple polynomials which contain information about the zeros of the original polynomial:\n\\[\nx^4-x^3-3x^2+5x-2 =(x+2)(x-1)(x-1)(x-1)+0\n\\]\nHere is a summary of the sequence of steps:\n\nThe lower the degree of the polynomial the easier it is to find its zeros. Figuring out the original zero (the zero of \\(f\\)) is the hardest part. If it is found, even if trial and error is used, a domino effect starts.\n\n\nWhy factoring polynomials is useful?\nThe rhs of this decomposition allow us to know easily when the lhs is positive and negative, i.e., it allow us to easily solve inequations of the form:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\,\\,|\\,\\,x^4-x^3-3x^2+5x-1&gt;0\\}\\\\\n\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\,\\,|\\,\\,x^4-x^3-3x^2+5x-1&lt;0\\}\n\\end{align}\n\\] the reason being, it is easy to picture polynomials of degree one (the factors):"

Figuring out the original zero (the zero of \\(f\\)) is the hardest part, a graph might help in our guess work, if nothing else, just use trial and error. If it is found, congrats yourself, you just made one step of \\(n\\) steps.\n\nWhy factoring polynomials is cool?\nOne key aspect one should keep in mind, is that finding the zeros of a polynomial and factored polynomial goes hand in hand. As we seen, the zeros of \\(x^4-x^3-3x^2+5x-2\\) are the singlet \\(-2\\), and the triplet of \\(1\\); knowing this allowed us to write this polynomial as \\((x+2)(x-1)^3\\). Going the other way around, starting from a polynomial given by \\((x+2)(x-1)^3\\) we know, just by looking at this formula, the zeros are \\(-2\\) and a triplet \\(1\\). Knowing the zeros is important or should I say knowing the factored form of a polynomial is important because, in-between those zeros, the polynomial must either positive (above the x-axis) or negative (below the x-axis). Additionally, note that the factored form of a polynomial is a product of simple polynomials, in the current case it the product of four terms of degree one, \\(x+2\\) and three \\(x-1\\); the sign (positive or negative) of each is easily computed, they are just lines in the plane! As a result the sign of the product polynomial can also be easily computed from the sign of the a product of the terms. It goes without saying: The good polynomial is the factored polynomial.\nWhat we intend to do now is precisely to find the sign (positive or negative) of the product polynomial in-between the zeros (\\(-2\\) and \\(1\\)), in other words, we want to compute the following sets:\n\\[ \\begin{align} \\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\,\\,|\\,\\,x^4-x^3-3x^2+5x-1&gt;0\\}\\\\ \\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\,\\,|\\,\\,x^4-x^3-3x^2+5x-1&lt;0\\} \\end{align}  \\tag{17}\\] We already know the zeros of \\(x ^ 4-x ^ 3-3x^2+5x-1\\) which are embedded in the terms\n\n\\(x+2\\) is zero at \\(x=-2\\)\n\\(x-1\\) has a zero at \\(x=1\\)\n\nNow, to compute the sign of the term, draw a table as follows: in the first column put the factors, the first row is suppose to represent the real line, in it we highlight key points, which in the present case are the zeros of the factors, the point at \\(-2\\) and \\(1\\) , and as reference we should include the infinities as well:\n\n\n\nReal line\n\\(-\\infty\\)\n\n\\(-2\\)\n\n\\(1\\)\n\n\\(\\infty\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(x+2\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\n\n\\(x-1\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\n\n\\(x-1\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\n\n\\(x-1\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\n\n\\((x+2)(x-1)^3\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\n\n\nHere an equivalent but clearer picture of this table, which I prefer:\n\nIn the rows \\(x+2\\) and \\(x-1\\) fill the zeros as \\(x=-2\\) and \\(x=1\\) respectively. Now, take the \\(x+2\\) row as an example, there is only one zero, hence before that zero we have a definite sign and after this zero we have also a definite sign, to find these signs we can just pick any two \\(x\\)-values, picking \\(x=-3\\) and \\(x=1\\) we compute \\(-3+2 = -1\\) which is negative and thus the region \\((-\\infty,-2)\\) must be negative; computing \\(1+2=3\\) we get a positive value, thus the region \\((-2,\\infty)\\) is positive. We repeat the same approach and pick two numbers, one before and other after \\(x=1\\) the zero of \\(x-1\\) to check its sign, the results are shown above.\nThe last row is also easy to fill from the signs of \\(x+2\\) and \\((x-1)^3\\). Notice the cube power, being an odd number, does not change the sign of \\(x-1\\).\nFrom the last row we can read the answer for our question ?@eq-set_in_question , we conclude:\n\\[ \\begin{align} &\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\,\\,|\\,\\,x^4-x^3-3x^2+5x-1&gt;0\\}=(-\\infty,-2)\\cup (1,+\\infty)\\\\ &\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\,\\,|\\,\\,x^4-x^3-3x^2+5x-1&lt;0\\}=(-2,1) \\end{align} \\] The table method to find the signs of a complicated polynomial is fine and good, but I would like to emphasize the central idea behind it. What the table essentially is, is a representation of the graph of the factors with just the signs singled out. As such an alternative way, which I actually prefer, to find the answer to Equation 17 is to just graph the terms of the product polynomial:\n\nAnd from it read the signs from the lines:"

Guessing the answer we find \\(q'=1\\) and as a result \\(r'=4-1\\cdot 3=1\\) and thus\n\\[\n4 = 1\\times 3 +1\n\\tag{18}\\]\nCombining the results Equation 17 and Equation 18 we find:\n\\[\n22 = 6\\times 3 + 1\\times 3 +1\n\\]\nSimplifying we get the division of \\(22\\) where the \\(q=7\\) is as large as possible and the \\(r=1\\) is small as possible:\n\\[\n22 = 7\\times 3 +1\n\\]\n\n\nGuess 2: \\(q=7\\) because \\(7\\cdot 3=21\\) is above \\(2\\cdot 10\\) but close.\nSubstituting we obtain:\n\\[\n22 = 7\\times 3 + r\n\\]\nwhich is equivalent to\n\\[\nr = 22-21 = 1\n\\]\nOur remainder \\(r\\) is smaller than \\(3\\), no further division of \\(r\\) by \\(3\\) is needed, we conclude again that\n\\[\n22 = 7\\times 3 +1\n\\]\n\n\nGuess 3: \\(q=8\\) gives \\(8\\cdot 3=24\\) which is again close to \\(2\\cdot 10\\)\nWhat happens when our guess is above the actual answer?

    "text": "Example 3: \\(1001/12\\) using elementary school’s long division (LD)\nTo complement and expand on the previous example, let us consider now a more sophisticated division \\(1001/12\\), how do we argue as in elementary school?\nStep 1: We observe the number \\(1001\\) we lump digits from left to right and ask whether the lumped is larger (and thus divisible) than \\(12\\):\n\nThe first lump is just the digit \\(1\\) on the left in \\(1001\\), it is smaller than \\(12\\) and thus not divisible.\nWhat does this means? Focusing on the first digit and checking whether it is divisible by \\(12\\) is equivalent to decompose \\(1001\\) as \\(1001 = 1\\cdot 10^3 +1\\) and trying to guess what \\(q\\) that makes \\(q\\cdot 12\\) best cover the \\(1\\cdot 10^3\\) on the lhs of:\n\\[\n1\\cdot 10^3 +1 = q\\cdot 12+r\n\\]\nInstead of trying to solve this problem the elementary school algorithm, tell us, instead, to lumps the first two digits of \\(1001\\), and try again: [Is \\(10\\) divisible by \\(12\\)?].\nThe second lump is \\(10\\). Once again we see \\(10\\) is not divisible by \\(12\\) since \\(10&lt;12\\).\nWhat does this line of reasoning mean? Lumping the first two digits on the left trying to divide by \\(12\\) is equivalent to to trying to solve the equation:\n\\[\n10\\cdot 10^2 +1 = q\\cdot 12+r\n\\]\nNotice that we could do it, a good guess would be \\(q=10^2\\) again, but we do not follow this path, as stated by the LD we should instead lump the three digits on the left and try again by asking [Is \\(100\\) divisible by \\(12\\)?].\nThe third lump is \\(100\\). Yes! Since \\(100&gt;12\\), we finally have a lump which we can divide by \\(12\\). How many times \\(12\\) fits in \\(100\\)? After some thought and side calculations we arrive at the answer \\(8\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does this mean? The question implicit in this step of LD is: Can you find \\(q\\) and \\(r\\) such that:\n\\[\n100 \\cdot 10 +1 = q\\cdot 12 +r\n\\tag{19}\\]\nYes we can, guessing \\(q=8\\cdot10\\) we can easily make \\(q\\cdot 12\\) cover the largest term \\(100\\cdot 10\\) on the lhs of Equation 19 . In case the \\(8\\cdot 10\\) guess is not clear, note that \\(12\\) fits \\(8\\) times in \\(100\\), but since what we actually have is \\(100\\cdot 10\\) we have to multiply the \\(8\\) by \\(10\\) giving us the \\(q=8\\cdot 10\\). The fact that \\(8\\) comes multiplied by \\(10\\) is the reason why we put in the ten’s place (under the \\(1\\) in \\(12\\)):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: The next step in LD is to multiply \\(8\\times 12 = 96\\) and place it under the ten’s place of \\(1001\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does this step mean? Because, \\(8\\) is under the ten’s place, we should see it as \\(8\\cdot 10\\) and not just an \\(8\\), thus this step is doing the calculation \\(8\\times 10 \\times 12 =960\\), rewriting the \\(960\\) as a \\(96\\cdot 10\\) tell us we should put a \\(96\\) in the ten’s place under the \\(1001\\) .\nStep 3: Next in LD is to compute the difference \\(100-96=4\\) and then drop the rightmost \\(1\\) in \\(1001\\):\nWhat does this step mean?\nThis step is the computation of the remainder of Equation 19 for our first guess \\(q=8\\cdot 10\\):\n\\[ \\begin{align} &100\\times 10 +1 = 8\\cdot 10\\cdot 12 +r\\\\ \\implies &r= (100-96)\\times 10+1\\\\\n\\implies & r=4\\times 10 +1 \\end{align}  \\tag{20}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the remainder \\(r=41\\) does not satisfy \\(0\\leq r&lt;12\\), it is not the smallest it can be, i.e., \\(12\\) still fits in it a few number of times, the LD does not stop here - inside the problem we are attempting to solve \\(1001/12\\) we found a sub-problem, which is now to divide \\(41\\) by \\(12\\). How many times is \\(12\\) in \\(41\\)?\nStep 4: Just like we lumped digits from the left in \\(1001\\) and did check whether they are or not divisible by \\(12\\), we now do the same with \\(41\\): The first lump is just \\(4\\), which is not divisible by \\(12\\), so we lump the first two digits giving us \\(41\\).

Give your \\(d=3\\) friends chocolate pieces of length \\(q=7\\); a small one of length \\(1\\) remains, you can eat that as a prize.\nThe takeaway is that when you divide two things and the result you desire must be an integer thing, then a remaining thing is left (for you).\nI would like now to make things more complicated and write the statement above in proper math language, its a theorem:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem\n\n\n\nLet \\(p\\) and \\(d\\) be two integers where \\(p\\geq d\\). Then there exists an integer \\(r\\) such that \\(0\\leq r&lt;d\\) and an integer \\(q\\geq 0\\) such that\n\\[ p=qd+r \\]\n\n\nLets break down the meaning of this theorem. We start by requiring that \\(p\\) and \\(d\\) be integers (a chocolate bar has an integer number of pieces and you have an integer number of friends - right?) and thus positive, we also require that \\(p\\) is larger or equal to \\(d\\).\nIf we imagine \\(p\\) as the length of a line segment (our chocolate bar), this length is the sum of two length\n\\[\np=qd + r\n\\]\nThe \\(qd\\) length, is the length of each piece you give your friends times the number of friends, thus \\(qd\\) is the part of the chocolate bar you give away.\nThe \\(r\\) length, is the length of the remaining piece, you keep that!\nSumming both, \\(qd +r\\) yields the original chocolate bar length \\(p\\).\n\nTo divide \\(p\\) by \\(d\\) subjected to the fact we want an integer result, means to find the integer result \\(q\\) and then the integer remainder \\(r\\).\nIn practice, when we seek for the value of \\(q\\), we seek for the highest possible \\(q\\), that way ensures the smallest length \\(r\\). By smallest I mean, its length \\(r\\) is not divisible by \\(d\\) - Please STOP here and ensure you understand this!\nWe can guarantee that \\(r\\) is not divisible by \\(d\\) by stating that \\(r\\) must be smaller than \\(d\\), thus the requirement \\(0\\leq r&lt;d\\) in the theorem above."

    "text": "3) The key strategy behind computing the division of integers\nTo compute the division of the integer \\(1001\\) by \\(12\\) under the constrain that the result is also an integer is to compute the values of \\(q\\) and \\(r\\) that obey the following equation:\n\\[ 1001 = q \\times 12 + r \\qquad 0\\leq r&lt;12 \\]\nHow do we proceed in finding these numbers? The key strategy is very simple: guess them!\nIts not a random guess, this is not a lottery, its an educated guess; educated by clues provided by the problem itself.\nSee the following line of reasoning (and guesses) to get the idea:\n\nStep 1: decompose \\(1001\\) and \\(12\\) into powers of \\(10\\). This a clue that will to aid (educate) our guesses!\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n1001 = 1\\cdot 10^3+0\\cdot 10^2 +0\\cdot 10^1+1\\cdot 10^0 = 1\\cdot 10^3 +1\\cdot 10^0\\\\\n12 = 1\\cdot 10^1 + 2\\cdot 10^0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nStep 2: Observe both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 1\\cdot 10^3 +1 = q\\cdot(10+2)+r  \\tag{2}\\]\nIt is very useful to identify what are the largest numbers on both sides of the equation: the largest value on the left side is \\(1\\cdot 10^3\\), the largest value on the right side is \\(q\\cdot 10\\). Hence we expect that whatever \\(q\\) is, it must, when multiplied by \\(10\\), to give a number with is close or equal to \\(1\\cdot 10^3\\), for otherwise, balancing the sides of the equation is impossible. We should balance first these two terms, then we deal with the smaller ones.\nOur guess of \\(q\\) must be guided by this observation.\nStep 3: Guess a value of \\(q\\) which makes large terms similar or equal, i.e., \\(q\\cdot 10\\) close to \\(1\\cdot 10^3\\). There are many possible guesses and all of them would work! Here is one possibility \\(q=10^2\\).\nStep 4: Now that we have a value for \\(q\\) lets see how large is the remainder.\nSubstituting \\(q=10^2\\) into Equation 2 gives:\n\\[ \\begin{align} &1\\cdot 10^3 +1 = 1\\cdot 10^3 +2 \\cdot 10^2 + r\\\\ \\implies&r=-2\\cdot10^2+1 \\end{align} \\]\nThe remainder is negative and this presents no problem, what we really want is the final remainder to be positive. The remainder is also larger (in absolute value) than the divisor \\(12\\). This means the remainder is still divisible by \\(12\\), hence we proceed into computing the division of \\(-2\\cdot 10 +1\\) by \\(12\\), this is what we’ll do in step 5. To end step 4 let us summarize in a single expression what we know so far:\n\\[\n1\\cdot 10^3+1=\\overbrace{10^2}^q\\cdot(10+2)+\\overbrace{(-2\\cdot 10^2+1)}^r\n\\tag{3}\\]\nStep 5: Write the division of the remainder \\(-2\\cdot 10+1\\) by \\(12\\):\n\\[\n-2\\cdot 10^2+1 = q'\\cdot(10+2)+r'\n\\]\nand analyse the equation.\nOur goal now is to guess \\(q'\\) that makes \\(r'\\) as small as possible, we achieve that by balancing the largest terms on both sides of the equation, in this case we want to guess a \\(q'\\) that when multiplied by \\(10\\) is close to \\(-2\\cdot 10^2\\), the largest number on the left.\nStep 6: Guess \\(q'=-2\\cdot 10\\) and then substitute into the equation:\n\\[ \\begin{align} &-2\\cdot 10^2+1 = -2\\cdot 10^2 -4\\cdot 10 + r'\\\\ \\implies &r'=4\\cdot 10+1 \\end{align} \\]\nThe remainder is \\(4\\cdot 10+1\\) and is still larger than \\(12\\), thus divisible by \\(12\\), we’ll do this calculation in step 7. Let’s end this step by summarizing what we know so far:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n1\\cdot 10^3+1=\\overbrace{10^2}^q\\cdot(10+2)+\\overbrace{(-2\\cdot 10^2+1)}^r\\\\\n-2\\cdot10^2+1 =\\overbrace{(-2\\cdot10)}^{q'}\\cdot(10+2)+\\overbrace{(4\\cdot10+1)}^{r'}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nStep 7: We repeat the process. Write the equation for the division of the current remainder \\(4\\cdot 10+1\\) by \\(12\\), analyse it and guess the quotient \\(q''\\) that makes \\(r''\\) as small as possible:\n\\[\n4\\cdot 10 +1 = q''\\cdot (10+2)+r''\n\\tag{4}\\]\nGuessing \\(q''=4\\) webalance the largest term on the lhs. The corresponding remainder is:\n\\[\nr'' = -7\n\\]\nSince the remainder is smaller than \\(12\\) the guessing process ends here.\nOnce again we summarize everything we know so far:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n1\\cdot 10^3+1=\\overbrace{10^2}^q\\cdot(10+2)+\\overbrace{(-2\\cdot 10^2+1)}^r\\\\\n-2\\cdot10^2+1 =\\overbrace{(-2\\cdot10)}^{q'}\\cdot(10+2)+\\overbrace{(4\\cdot10+1)}^{r'}\\\\\n4\\cdot 10+1 = \\overbrace{4}^{q''}\\cdot(10+2)+\\overbrace{(-7)}^{r''}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nStep 7: Use ?@eq-summary to write\n\\[\n1\\cdot 10^3 +1 = (10^2-2\\cdot 10+4)\\cdot 12 -7\n\\]\nwhich simplifies into:\n\\[\n1001=84\\cdot 12 -7\n\\tag{5}\\]\nStep 8: Our final remainder, the \\(-7\\) in Equation 5 is negative, to make it positive we resort to a trick: add \\(0=12-12\\) to the rhs:\n\\[ 1001=(84-1)\\cdot 12+(12-7) \\]\nIn conclusion:\n\\[ 1001=83\\cdot 12 +5 \\]\nThe division is complete, our quotient is \\(q=83\\) and the remainder is the positive number \\(5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\nThe division of \\(1001\\) by \\(12\\) can be done in many ways, all ending in the result \\(1001=83\\cdot 12 +5\\). What distinguishes the different ways are the guesses of \\(q\\), \\(q''\\), etc one makes. Among all this approaches we find one very well known by you, the long division of integers, which you learned in elementary school.\nThe particular sequence of steps we followed above was chosen so that it can be compared with the sequence of step in dividing \\(x^3+1\\) by \\(x+2\\).\n\n\n\nIn practice, when we seek the length \\(q\\) of each one of the \\(d\\) tilts to cover the line segment \\(p\\), we seek for the highest possible \\(q\\), that way ensures the smallest correction \\(r\\). By smallest I mean, the corrective tilt of length \\(r\\) is not divisible by \\(d\\), and we can guarantee that by stating that \\(r\\) must be smaller than \\(d\\), thus the requirement \\(0\\leq r&lt;d\\) in the theorem.\nOur goal in this sections is to introduce the fundamental ideas necessary for this calculation. The first of which is: Computing \\((x^3+1)/(x+2)\\) is equivalent to solving the equation\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\nx^3+1 = q(x)(x+2) +r(x)\n\\end{equation}\n\\tag{6}\\]\nfor \\(q(x)\\) and \\(r(x)\\). To see the equivalence between these two problems more clearly, just rearrange Equation 6 into:\n\\[\n\\frac{x^3+1}{x+2} = q(x) +\\frac{r(x)}{x+2}\n\\tag{7}\\]\nWhat do we see now? On the left hand side, the polynomial we want to compute, on the right hand side of the equation we see \\(q(x)\\), the quotient, a polynomial we think \\((x^3+1)/(x+2)\\) represents, but! Since in many examples this representation is not exact (as we shall see) we need to add to it a final correction \\(r(x)/(x+2)\\) to make the equality between the sides, exact. Equation 6 is the one line version of the quotient operation we traditionally think as Equation 7 .\nWhat is this \\(r(x)\\)? To answer just observe Equation 6, note that the polynomial \\(p(x)=x^3+1\\) is split into a sum of two special polynomials: one of them is fully divisible by \\(d(x)\\) which is the polynomial \\(q(x)(x+2)\\), while the other is not, it is called the remainder \\(r(x)\\), because it represents the part of \\(x^3+1\\) which was not fully divisible by \\(x+2\\), and thus remains to be divisible, the following picture shows the key parts of Equation 7 :\n\nAll this will become clear when we see examples, for now lets just write what is \\(q(x)\\) and \\(r(x)\\) for the divisions in Equation 1 :\n\nthe oneline-quotient formula that relates \\(x^3+1\\) and \\(x+2\\) is \\(x^3+1 = (x^2-2x+4)(x+2)-7\\). Here \\(q(x)\\) is \\(x^2-2x+4\\) which when multiplied by \\(d(x)=x+2\\) does not gives us exactly the original \\(p(x)=x^3+1\\), almost! After adding the correction \\(r(x)=-7\\), the equality is restored; \\(-7\\) is the part inside \\(p(x)\\) which was not divisible by \\(x+2\\), so it appear as the remainder - what remains of \\(p(x)\\) to be divisible.\nthe equation that relates \\(x^3+1\\) and \\(x+1\\) is \\(x^3+1 = (x^2-x+1)(x+1)\\). This time the remainder is zero, \\(r(x)=0\\), the polynomial \\(p(x)=x^3+1\\) is fully divisible by \\(d(x)=x+1\\), not a part of it remains indivisible by \\(x+1\\), so no correction is need.\n\nThe algorithm to compute the division of polynomials is a sequence of steps we can follow to find \\(q(x)\\) and \\(r(x)\\) from the given \\(p(x)\\) and \\(d(x)\\), this algorithm is analogous to the algorithm of long division of integers learned in elementary school. We shall start by recalling the basic ideas behind long division of integer and then use them later in the division of polynomials."

    "text": "5) The key strategy behind computing the division of polynomials and an example\nAs usual we guess what \\(q(x)\\) might be and then compute the corresponding remainder \\(r(x)\\). By checking the constraint \\(0\\leq \\deg r&lt;1\\) at each stage of the guessing process, we decide whether to terminate it or keep going. Let us see this in practice:\n\nStep 1: Observe both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x^3+1=q(x)\\times(x+2)+r(x) \\qquad 0\\leq\\deg r &lt; 1   \\tag{8}\\]\nand identify the largest powers: on the lhs we have \\(x^3\\) and on the rhs we have \\(q(x) \\cdot x\\). This is useful information, because we want to match the largest powers on either side of the equation. This is the only way the equal sign will hold.\nStep 2: We want to guess what \\(q(x)\\) based on this matching observation we did at step 1, hence \\(q(x)=x^2\\) :\nSubstituting into Equation 8, we compute the remainder of the current guess:\n\\[ \\begin{align} &x^3+1=x^2\\times(x+2)+r(x)\\\\ \\implies &r(x) = -2x^2+1 \\end{align} \\]\nIs the constraint that the remainder is as “small” as possible, \\(0\\leq \\deg r &lt;1\\), satisfied by this remainder? We clearly see from the \\(x^2\\) power that its degree is \\(2\\), the constraint is not satisfied and that means this remainder is divisible by \\(x+2\\).\nAs we did for the integer division we summarize our calculations:\n\\[\nx^3+1 = x^2\\cdot(x+2)+\\overbrace{(-2x^2+1)}^r\n\\]\n\n\n\nStep 3: The division \\((-2x^2+1)/(x+2)\\) is done by guessing the quotient \\(q'(x)\\) and the remainder \\(r'(x)\\):\n\\[ -2x^2+1 = q'(x)(x+2)+r'(x)  \\tag{9}\\]\nWe proceed as we always did above and analyze the equation before attempting any guess.

Using polynomial division we find, as expected, a complete division, nothing remains, \\(r=0\\):\n\\[ \\overbrace{x^4 -x^3-3x^2+5x-2}^f = \\overbrace{(x^3-3x+2)}^q(x-1)+\\overbrace{0}^r \\]\nBut inspection of \\(q\\) reveals that \\(q(1)=0\\), the quotient has a zero as well, using again polynomial division we find \\(r'=0\\):\n\\[ \\overbrace{x^3-3x+2}^q = \\overbrace{(x^2+x-2)}^{q'}(x-1)+\\overbrace{0}^{r'} \\]\nIn general if we know a zero of \\(q\\) then again, division of \\(q(x)\\) by \\(x-\\text{zero of $q$}\\) yields again a zero remainder:\n\nTherefore:\n\nAnd the same story continues with \\(q'\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommentary\n\n\n\nNotice that a zero of \\(q\\) is automatically a zero of \\(f\\).

    "text": "7) Why factoring polynomials is cool?\nOne key aspect one should keep in mind, is that finding the zeros of a polynomial and factored polynomial goes hand in hand. As we seen, the zeros of \\(x^4-x^3-3x^2+5x-2\\) are the singlet \\(-2\\), and the triplet of \\(1\\); knowing this allowed us to write this polynomial as \\((x+2)(x-1)^3\\). Going the other way around, starting from a polynomial given by \\((x+2)(x-1)^3\\) we know, just by looking at this formula, the zeros are \\(-2\\) and a triplet \\(1\\). Knowing the zeros is important or should I say knowing the factored form of a polynomial is important because, in-between those zeros, the polynomial must either positive (above the x-axis) or negative (below the x-axis). Additionally, note that the factored form of a polynomial is a product of atomic polynomials, in the current case it the product of four terms of degree one, \\(x+2\\) and three \\(x-1\\); the sign (positive or negative) of each is easily computed, they are just lines in the plane! As a result the sign of the product polynomial can also be easily computed from the sign of the a product of the terms. It goes without saying: The good polynomial is the factored polynomial.\nWhat we intend to do now is precisely to find the sign (positive or negative) of the product polynomial in-between the zeros (\\(-2\\) and \\(1\\)), in other words, we want to compute the following sets:\n\\[ \\begin{align} \\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\,\\,|\\,\\,x^4-x^3-3x^2+5x-1&gt;0\\}\\\\ \\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\,\\,|\\,\\,x^4-x^3-3x^2+5x-1&lt;0\\} \\end{align}  \\tag{12}\\] We already know the zeros of \\(x ^ 4-x ^ 3-3x^2+5x-1\\) which are embedded in the terms\n\n\\(x+2\\) is zero at \\(x=-2\\)\n\\(x-1\\) has a zero at \\(x=1\\)\n\nNow, to compute the sign of the term, draw a table as follows: in the first column put the factors, the first row is suppose to represent the real line, in it we highlight key points, which in the present case are the zeros of the factors, the point at \\(-2\\) and \\(1\\) , and as reference we should include the infinities (“end points” of the real line) as well:\n\n\n\nReal line\n\\(-\\infty\\)\n\n\\(-2\\)\n\n\\(1\\)\n\n\\(\\infty\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(x+2\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\n\n\\(x-1\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\n\n\\(x-1\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\n\n\\(x-1\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\n\n\\((x+2)(x-1)^3\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\\(+\\)\n\n\n\nHere an equivalent but clearer picture of this table, which I prefer:\n\nIn the rows \\(x+2\\) and \\(x-1\\) fill the zeros as \\(x=-2\\) and \\(x=1\\) respectively. Now, take the \\(x+2\\) row as an example, there is only one zero, hence before that zero we have a definite sign and after this zero we have also a definite sign, to find these signs we can just pick any two \\(x\\)-values, picking \\(x=-3\\) and \\(x=1\\) we compute \\(-3+2 = -1\\) which is negative and thus the region \\((-\\infty,-2)\\) must be negative; computing \\(1+2=3\\) we get a positive value, thus the region \\((-2,\\infty)\\) is positive. We repeat the same approach and pick two numbers, one before and other after \\(x=1\\) the zero of \\(x-1\\) to check its sign, the results are shown above.\nThe last row is also easy to fill from the signs of \\(x+2\\) and \\((x-1)^3\\). Notice the cube power, being an odd number, does not change the sign of \\(x-1\\).\nFrom the last row we can read the answer for our question Equation 12 , we conclude:\n\\[ \\begin{align} &\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\,\\,|\\,\\,x^4-x^3-3x^2+5x-1&gt;0\\}=(-\\infty,-2)\\cup (1,+\\infty)\\\\ &\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\,\\,|\\,\\,x^4-x^3-3x^2+5x-1&lt;0\\}=(-2,1) \\end{align} \\] The table method to find the signs of a complicated polynomial is fine and good, but I would like to emphasize the central idea behind it. What the table essentially is, is a representation of the graph of the factors with just the signs singled out. As such an alternative way, which I actually prefer, to find the answer to Equation 12 is to just graph the terms of the product polynomial:\n\nAnd from it read the signs from the lines:\nCool ! :)"

The map between these coordinates is established by the equations:\n\\[ \\begin{align} & x = r \\sin \\theta \\cos \\phi\\\\ & y = r \\sin \\theta \\sin \\phi\\\\ & z = r \\cos \\theta \\end{align} \\]\nprovided \\(r\\geq 0\\), \\(0\\leq\\theta\\leq\\pi\\) and \\(0\\leq\\phi&lt; 2\\pi\\).\nTo convert Equation 34 and Equation 35 into polar coordinates we proceed as follows:\n\nDraw a diagram:\n\n\n\nRelate the derivatives in cartesian and polar coordinates encoded in the diagram:\n\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial_r\\psi\\\\ \\partial_\\theta\\psi\\\\ \\partial_\\phi\\psi \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial_r x & \\partial_r y & \\partial_r z\\\\ \\partial_\\theta x & \\partial_\\theta y & \\partial_\\theta z\\\\ \\partial_\\phi x & \\partial_\\phi y & \\partial_\\phi z \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial_x\\psi\\\\ \\partial_y \\psi\\\\ \\partial_z \\psi \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nCompute the matrix (Easy)\n\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi & \\sin\\theta \\sin \\phi & \\cos\\theta\\\\ r \\cos\\theta \\cos\\phi & r \\cos\\theta \\sin \\phi & -r \\sin \\theta\\\\ -r\\sin\\theta \\sin \\phi & r \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi & 0 \\end{pmatrix}  \\tag{36}\\]\n\nInvert the system Equation 36 (Hard, use Mathematica)\n\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial_x\\psi\\\\ \\partial_y\\psi\\\\ \\partial_z\\psi \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta \\cos \\phi   & r^{-1}\\cos\\theta \\cos\\phi & -(r\\sin\\theta)^{-1} \\sin\\phi\\\\ \\sin\\theta \\sin \\phi   & r^{-1}\\cos\\theta \\sin\\phi & (r\\sin\\theta)^{-1} \\cos\\phi\\\\ \\cos\\theta & -r^{-1}\\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial_r\\psi\\\\ \\partial_\\theta \\psi\\\\ \\partial_\\phi \\psi \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nSubstitute the results into Equation 34 and Equation 35 and simplify:\n\\[ \\begin{align} &L_x \\rightsquigarrow i\\hbar\\left(\\sin\\phi \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}+\\frac{\\cos\\phi}{\\tan\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\right)\\\\ &L_y \\rightsquigarrow i\\hbar\\left(-\\cos\\phi \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}+\\frac{\\sin\\phi}{\\tan\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\right)\\\\ &Lz \\rightsquigarrow \\frac{\\hbar}{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} \\end{align} \\]\nFrom these results we can now derive the action of \\(L^2\\) in polar coordinates:\n\\[ \\begin{align} L^2\\psi &= L_x^2\\psi + L_y^2\\psi+L_z^2\\psi\\\\ &=(i\\hbar)^2\\left(\\sin\\phi \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}+\\frac{\\cos\\phi}{\\tan\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\right)^2\\psi +(i\\hbar)^2\\left(-\\cos\\phi \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}+\\frac{\\sin\\phi}{\\tan\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\right)^2\\psi+ \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{i}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\phi^2}\\psi \\end{align}  \\tag{37}\\] Now we need to expand each square, the first becomes:\n\n\\[ (i\\hbar)^2\\left(\\sin^2\\phi \\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial \\theta^2}+ \\frac{\\cos^2\\phi}{\\tan^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial \\phi^2}-\\frac{\\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi}{\\sin^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\phi}+\\frac{\\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi}{\\tan\\theta}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial\\theta\\partial \\phi}\\right) \\]\nthe second term becomes:\n\\[ (i\\hbar)^2\\left(\\cos^2\\phi \\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial \\theta^2}+ \\frac{\\sin^2\\phi}{\\tan^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial \\phi^2}+\\frac{\\cos\\phi\\sin\\phi}{\\sin^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\phi}-\\frac{\\cos\\phi\\sin\\phi}{\\tan\\theta}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial\\theta\\partial \\phi}\\right) \\]\nSubstituting into Equation 37 and canceling terms yields the final result:\n\\[ L^2 \\rightsquigarrow -\\hbar^2\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\theta^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\theta} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\phi^2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan\\theta}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\right) \\]\nAs a consequence, the system of equations in Equation 33 becomes a system of partial differential equations:\n\\[ \\begin{align} &-\\hbar^2 \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta^2}+\\frac{1}{\\tan \\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}+\\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial^2 \\phi^2}\\right)\\psi_{l,m}(r, \\theta, \\phi)=l(l+1)\\hbar^2\\psi_{l,m}(r, \\theta, \\phi)\\\\ & \\frac{\\hbar}{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\psi_{l,m}(r, \\theta, \\phi)=m\\hbar \\psi_{l,m}(r, \\theta, \\phi) \\end{align} \\]\nThe solutions \\(\\psi_{l,m}(r,\\theta,\\phi)\\) are the eigenfunctions common to the \\(L^2\\) and \\(L_z\\) operators associated with the eigenvalues \\(l(l+1)\\hbar^2\\) and \\(m\\hbar\\).

    "text": "We note that the CSCO that is about to generate a basis for \\(\\mathcal{E}(S_{12}=1)\\otimes \\mathcal{E}(j_3=1/2)\\) is given by \\[\n\\{\\overbrace{S_1^2,S_2^2}^\\text{background};\\overbrace{S_{12}^2,S_{12}^z}^\\text{1st spin},\\overbrace{S_3^2,S_3^z}^\\text{2ndspin}\\}\n\\] We can split this set into three parts: (1st spin) the essential operators that we need to specify the state of the two spins in the system, but since one of those spin results from a previous addition, we supplement (background) the information that we added two spins with \\(s_1=s_2=1/2\\) by the inclusion of the operators \\(S_1^2\\) and \\(S_2^2\\), we can think of them as background information; the state for the third spin is stated at last in (2nd spin). These six operators commute among each other and as a result we can define a basis of eigenvectors common to all the observables, which is indexed by the corresponding quantum numbers:\n\\[\n\\ket{s_1,s_2;S_{12},M_{12},s_3,m_3}\n\\] What do we know about these states? - \\(s_1=s_2=1/2\\) - \\(0=|j_1-j_2|\\leq S_{12}\\leq j_1+j_2=1\\) in steps of \\(1\\) - \\(-1\\leq M_{12}\\leq 1\\) - \\(s_3=1/2\\) - \\(-1/2\\leq m_3\\leq 1/2\\) - \\(\\ket{s_1,s_2;S_{12},M_{12},s_3,m_3}:=\\ket{s_1,s_2;S_{12},M_{12}}\\otimes\\ket{s_3,m_3}\\) - Moreover we know the ket \\(\\ket{s_1,s_2;S_{12},M_{12}}\\) can be written in terms of the individual states of electron \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) either as a singlet or triplet state, see above. We can organize this basis with the following picture:\n\nLets us now change the basis of our space, for that we choose the new CSCO: \\[\n\\{\\overbrace{S_1^2,S_2^2,S_3^2,S_{12}^2}^\\text{background};\\overbrace{S_{tot}^2,S_{tot}^z}^\\text{total spin}\\}\n\\] whose eigenbasis is defined as usual by the quantum numbers determining each eigenvalue of the observables in the set: \\[\n\\ket{s_1,s_2,s_3,S_{12};S_{tot},M_{tot}}\n\\] Specifically we are interested in the basis states which have \\[\ns_1=s_2=s_3=1/2\\qquad S_{12}=1\n\\] The operators \\(S_{tot}^2\\) and \\(S_{tot}^z\\) describe the magnitude and the \\(z-\\)component angular momentum operators and we know from the general rules of angular momentum that the following relation holds: \\[\n-S_{tot}\\leq M_{tot}\\leq S_{tot}\n\\] We do not know what \\(S_{tot}\\) is, yet, just like we did not know what was \\(S_{12}\\) when we added the systems 1+2. But we can guess what it is from the possible values of \\(M_{tot}\\), just as we did to guess what \\(S_{12}\\) was from the known values of \\(M=m_1+m_2\\). Since the basis kets of the old basis are also eigenvectors of \\(S_{tot}^z\\) let us compute the corresponding eigenvalues, we summarize the results by the pink boxes in the following picture:\n\nKnowing that \\(M_{tot}=-3/2,-1/2,1/2,3/2\\) and the fact that these numbers must be between \\(-S_{tot}\\) and \\(S_{tot}\\) we attempt to reconstruct the diagram that organizes the basis:\n\nFrom the picture we conclude we must have either \\(S_{tot}=1/2,3/2\\) and we confirm again the general rule: \\[\n1/2=|S_{12}-s_3|\\leq S_{tot}\\leq S_{12}+s_3=3/2\\qquad \\text{in steps of }1\n\\] Let us now relate the old basis on the left with the new basis on the right:\n\nThe two subspaces \\(\\mathcal{E}(M_{tot}=3/2)\\) is one dimensional and thus: \\[\n\\ket{S_{tot}=3/2,M_{tot}=3/2}=\\ket{M_{12}=1}\\otimes\\ket{m_3=1/2}\n\\] The ket on the lhs now has meaning, besides its quantum number labels. Acting now with the lowering operator \\(S_{tot}^-=S_{12}^-+S_1^-\\) on this equality we find: \\[\nS_{tot}^-\n\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{3}{2}}=\\hbar\\sqrt{3}\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\] The right side of the equality is: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nS_{tot}^-\n\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{3}{2}}&=(S_{12}^-+S_1^-)(\\ket{1}\\otimes\\ket{\\frac{1}{2}})\\\\\n&=\\hbar\\sqrt{2}\\ket{0}\\otimes\\ket{\\frac{1}{2}}+\\hbar\\ket{1}\\otimes\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\end{align}\n\\] Therefore we conclude: \\[\n\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\ket{0}\\otimes\\ket{\\frac{1}{2}}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\ket{1}\\otimes\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\] We now seek to relate the eigenvector \\(\\ket{S_{tot}=1/2,M_{tot}=1/2}\\) with the old basis, we do that by writing its properties: - it must be a linear combination of the form: \\[\n\\ket{S_{tot}=1/2,M_{tot}=1/2}=\\alpha \\ket{0}\\otimes\\ket{\\frac{1}{2}} + \\beta \\ket{1}\\otimes\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\] - it must normalized: \\[\n|\\alpha|^2+|\\beta|^2=1\n\\] - it must be perpendicular to \\(\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}\\) we just computed with from our lowering operator. A pair of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) that satisfy all these constraints yields: \\[\n\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\ket{0}\\otimes\\ket{\\frac{1}{2}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} \\ket{1}\\otimes\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\] We can continue now and act with \\(S_{tot}^-\\) on \\(\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}\\) to get us \\(\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}\\): we find: \\[\n\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\ket{-1}\\otimes\\ket{\\frac{1}{2}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\ket{0}\\otimes\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\] The ket \\(\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}\\) is found from its properties just as we did for \\(\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}\\): \\[\n\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\ket{-1}\\otimes\\ket{\\frac{1}{2}}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\ket{0}\\otimes\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\] Finally we are left with: \\[\n\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},-\\frac{3}{2}}=\\ket{-1}\\otimes\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\] Since the subspace \\(\\mathcal{E}(M_{tot}=-3/2)\\) is one dimensional. ## Summary The eigenbasis of the CSCO \\(\\{S_1^2,S_2^2,S_3^2,S_{12}^2;S_{tot}^2,S_{tot}^z\\}\\) is related with the eigenbasis of the CSCO \\(\\{S_1^2,S_2^2;S_{12}^2,S_{12}^z,S_3^2,S_3^z\\}\\) as: \\(\\mathcal{E}(M_{12}=3/2)\\) \\[\n\\ket{S_{tot}=3/2,M_{tot}=3/2}=\\ket{M_{12}=1}\\otimes\\ket{m_3=1/2}\n\\] \\(\\mathcal{E}(M_{12}=1/2)\\) \\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\ket{S_{tot}=\\frac{3}{2},M_{tot}=\\frac{1}{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\ket{M_{12}=0}\\otimes\\ket{m_3=\\frac{1}{2}}+\\\\\n&\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\ket{M_{12}=1}\\otimes\\ket{m_3=-\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\\n&\\ket{S_{tot}=\\frac{1}{2},M_{tot}=\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\ket{M_{12}=0}\\otimes\\ket{m_3=\\frac{1}{2}} -\\\\\n&\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} \\ket{M_{12}=1}\\otimes\\ket{m_3=-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\end{align}\n\\] \\(\\mathcal{E}(M_{12}=-1/2)\\) \\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\ket{S_{tot}=\\frac{3}{2},M_{tot}=-\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\ket{M_{12}=-1}\\otimes\\ket{m_3=\\frac{1}{2}}+\\\\\n&\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\ket{M_{12}=0}\\otimes\\ket{m_3=-\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\\n&\\ket{S_{tot}=\\frac{1}{2},M_{tot}-\\frac{1}{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\ket{M_{12}=-1}\\otimes\\ket{m_3=\\frac{1}{2}}-\\\\\n&\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\ket{M_{12}=0}\\otimes\\ket{m_3=-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\end{align}\n\\] \\(\\mathcal{E}(M_{12}=-3/2)\\) \\[\n\\ket{S_{tot}=\\frac{3}{2},M_{tot}=-\\frac{3}{2}}=\\ket{M_{12}=-1}\\otimes\\ket{m_3=-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\] In turn we must now replace the basis kets \\(\\ket{S_{12}=1,M_{12}}\\) by the elements of the triplet ."

But we can guess what they are from the possible values of \\(M_{tot}\\), just as we did to guess what \\(S_{12}\\) was from the known values of \\(M=m_1+m_2\\), see 12).\nSince the kets of the old basis are also eigenvectors of \\(S_{tot}^z\\), let us act with this operator on the old basis to get the corresponding eigenvalues \\(M_{tot}\\), the calculations are analogous to Equation 29; we summarize the results by the pink boxes in the following picture:\n\nKnowing that \\(M_{tot}=-3/2,-1/2,1/2,3/2\\) and the fact that these numbers must be between \\(-S_{tot}\\) and \\(S_{tot}\\) we attempt to reconstruct the diagram that organizes the basis:\n\nFrom the picture we conclude we must have either \\(S_{tot}=1/2,3/2\\) and we confirm again the general rule: \\[\n1/2=|S_{12}-s_3|\\leq S_{tot}\\leq S_{12}+s_3=3/2\\qquad \\text{in steps of }1\n\\] Let us now relate the old basis on the left with the new basis on the right, the idea is exactly the same as in 13):\n\nThe two subspaces \\(\\mathcal{E}(M_{tot}=3/2)\\) are one dimensional and thus: \\[\n\\ket{S_{tot}=3/2,M_{tot}=3/2}=\\ket{M_{12}=1}\\otimes\\ket{m_3=1/2}\n\\]The ket on the lhs which previously was just a ket with indices of the eigenvalues, now has meaning, it is equal to the tensor product on the rhs.\nActing now with the lowering operator \\(S_{tot}^-=S_{12}^-+S_1^-\\) on this equality we find: \\[\nS_{tot}^-\n\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{3}{2}}=\\hbar\\sqrt{3}\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\] The right side of the equality is: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nS_{tot}^-\n\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{3}{2}}&=(S_{12}^-+S_1^-)(\\ket{1}\\otimes\\ket{\\frac{1}{2}})\\\\\n&=\\hbar\\sqrt{2}\\ket{0}\\otimes\\ket{\\frac{1}{2}}+\\hbar\\ket{1}\\otimes\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\end{align}\n\\] Therefore we conclude: \\[\n\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\ket{0}\\otimes\\ket{\\frac{1}{2}}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\ket{1}\\otimes\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\] We now seek to relate the eigenvector \\(\\ket{S_{tot}=1/2,M_{tot}=1/2}\\) with the old basis, we do that by writing its properties:\n\nit must be a linear combination of the form: \\[\n    \\ket{S_{tot}=1/2,M_{tot}=1/2}=\\alpha \\ket{0}\\otimes\\ket{\\frac{1}{2}} + \\beta \\ket{1}\\otimes\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n    \\]\nit must normalized: \\[\n|\\alpha|^2+|\\beta|^2=1\n\\]\nit must be perpendicular to \\(\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}\\) .\n\nA pair of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) that satisfy all the above constraints yields: \\[\n\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\ket{0}\\otimes\\ket{\\frac{1}{2}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} \\ket{1}\\otimes\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\] We can continue now and act with \\(S_{tot}^-\\) on \\(\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}\\) to get us \\(\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}\\); we find: \\[\n\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\ket{-1}\\otimes\\ket{\\frac{1}{2}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\ket{0}\\otimes\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\] The ket \\(\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}\\) is found from its properties just as we did for \\(\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}\\): \\[\n\\ket{\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\ket{-1}\\otimes\\ket{\\frac{1}{2}}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\ket{0}\\otimes\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\] Finally we are left with: \\[\n\\ket{\\frac{3}{2},-\\frac{3}{2}}=\\ket{-1}\\otimes\\ket{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\] since the subspace \\(\\mathcal{E}(M_{tot}=-3/2)\\) is one dimensional."
