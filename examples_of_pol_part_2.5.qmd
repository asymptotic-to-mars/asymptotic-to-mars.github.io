## Polynomials of degree one are lines

Polynomials of degree one are lists of ordered pairs of the form:

$$
\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2\,\,|\,\, y=a_1 x+a_0\}
$$ {#eq-poldeg1}

The constants $a_1$ and $a_0$ are either given to us or we must choose them - we say they are parameter of the function - they are the weights of $x^1$ and $x^0$ in the linear combination $a_1x+a_0$. Here are some examples of choices:

$$
\begin{align}
&\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2\,\,|\,\, y = -2x \}\\
&\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2\,\,|\,\, y = 2x \}\\
&\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2\,\,|\,\, y = x+1 \}\\
&\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2\,\,|\,\, y = -2x-1 \}
\end{align}
$$

Graphically these corresponds to lines in a plane:

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import numpy as np

xs = np.arange(-1.5, 1.6, 0.1)

plt.figure()
plt.plot(xs, -2 * xs, 'c-', label=r'$-2x$')
plt.plot(xs, 2 * xs, 'b-', label=r'$2x$')
plt.plot(xs, xs + 1, 'r-', label=r'$x+1$')
plt.plot(xs, -2 * xs -1, 'y-', label=r'$-2x-1$')
plt.xlabel(r'$x$')
plt.ylabel(r'$p_1(x)$')
plt.xticks(np.arange(min(xs), max(xs)+.1, .5))
plt.grid()
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

In maths, sometimes, changing just the aesthetic of the problem can bring great insight into what it means. Here is some changes into the aesthetic of the equation $y=a_1x+a_0$:

$$
y=a_1x+a_0 = a_1 x + a_0 + a_1 x_0 -a_1 x_0 = a_1(x-x_0)+(a_0+a_1x_0)
$$ {#eq-yisequalto}

Now define the following quantities:

$$
m:=a_1 \qquad y_0:=a_0+a_1x_0
$$ {#eq-defofonepolconstants}

Even if you have no clue how this can be a good idea, just wait and appreciate the consequences - the equation $y=a_1x+a_0$ shows up dressed differently:

$$
y=m(x-x_0)+y_0
$$ {#eq-alt}

the new clothing is introduced in @eq-defofonepolconstants .

It look different, a new aesthetic, but it is still the same equation as $y=a_1x+a_0$ because the parameters $a_1$, $a_0$, $m$, $x_0$ and $y_0$ are related through the equations @eq-defofonepolconstants. If values of some of these parameters are given, these equations can be used to compute the other.

As example: You give $a_0$ and $a_1$ and I can compute $x_0$ and $y_0$. How? If you give me $a_0=3$ and $a_1=2$, I pick an arbitrary $x_0$, for example $x_0=4$ and compute

$$
y_0=3+2\times 4=11
$$

In conclusion we have two equations aesthetically different but exactly the same:

$$
y=2x+3 \iff y=2(x-4)+11
$$ {#eq-example1}

The right hand side aesthetic is much better because it allow us to see easily how fast these polynomials of degree one increase.

<!--# What is $(x_0,y_0)$?  I mean, what is $(4,10)$ in @eq-example1 ? They are the coordinates of one particular point that belong to that line. It is very important to recognize that the line (or should I say, the set of points described by $y=2(x-4)+11$), could equally be described by the equations $y=2(x-3)+9$ or $y=2(x-1)+5$, or one of the infinitely many other possibilities. What makes them different is the choice of our favorite point $(x_0,y_0)$ of the line. For each, the equation of the line shows up with different clothing.  -->

### *How fast does the function increase?*

The constant $m$ (the $2$ in @eq-example1) is called the slope of the line, what does it mean the value of the slope? The meaning of this constant - in fact any constant in mathematics - can be deduced by analyzing the equation in which it appears. In this case, we understand $m$ by understanding $y=m(x-x_0)+y_0$, rearranging it we find:

$$
m=\frac{y-y_0}{x-x_0}
$$ {#eq-slope_formula}

which tells us that $m$ is a ratio of two distances, the height of the triangle $y-y_0$ and the length of the base of the triangle $x-x_0$.

![A line and two point.](figs/oneline.png){#fig-alineandtwopoints fig-env="fig-lineandtwopoints" width="407"}

Since $m$ is the ratio of these two distances, its sign determines weather the function is increasing or not. Observing @fig-window we see $x-x_0>0$ and $y-y_0>0$ therefore for this particular choice of two points we find $m>0$, the same conclusion would hold for any other. When $m$ is positive, then the $y$'s in $(x,y)$ increase when the $x$'s increase as well.

By the same line of reasoning the $m<0$ would correspond to decreasing function, one where as $x$ increases then the $y$'s decrease. And by the way, $m=0$ correspond to horizontal lines but these are polynomials of degree zero and not of degree one. The larger $m$ becomes the closer the line is to a vertical line, but it never truly becomes a vertical line.

We can actually arrive at these conclusions just looking at $y=m(x-x_0)+y_0$, no rearranging required: when $m$ is positive, then the greater $x-x_0$ is, the more we add to the default value $y_0$, thus the $y$ must increase; if on the other hand $m$ is negative, the term $m(x-x_0)$ can only become more negative as $x-x_0$ increases, thus lowering the value of $m(x-x_0)+y_0$, that is, the value of $y$, the function must be decreasing when $x-x_0$ increases.

### *Zeros*

What are the zeros in $P_1$? Look at @fig-alineandtwopoints, there are (in this case) two types of zeros: $x$-zeros and $y$-zeros. The $x$-zeros occur when the $x$ coordinate is zero and the $y$-zeros when $y$ is zero. In other words, the zeros of a polynomials of degree one are the ordered pairs (in $P_1$) that satisfy either one of these equations:

$$
\begin{equation}\begin{cases}y=y_0+m(x-x_0)\\y=0\end{cases}\qquad\qquad\begin{cases}y=y_0+m(x-x_0)\\x=0\end{cases}\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}\begin{cases}y_0=a_1x_0+a_0\\y=0\end{cases}\qquad\qquad\begin{cases}y=a_1x+a_0\\x=0\end{cases}\end{equation}
$$

$$
(x_0,0)\in \{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2\,\,|\,\, y = a_1x+a_0 \}
$$

$$
(0,y_0)\in \{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2\,\,|\,\, y = a_1x+a_0 \}
$$

Solving the first systems of equations we get $x=(0-y_0)/m+x_0$ and solving the second $y=y_0+m(0-x_0)$. Hence we know zeros of $P_1$:

$$
\begin{align}
&\textit{x-zero:} \qquad (0,y_0-mx_0)\\
&\textit{y-zero:} \qquad (x_0-y_0/m,0)
\end{align}
$$

### *When* $x$ *is large, then what?*

We can get to know qualitatively what happens with points coordinates of $P_1$ at its extreme ends of the set by supposing $x$ is a very, very large number; there is however an important key point: we are not particularly worried about a specific large value of $x$, like $x=10^{100}$ , and its corresponding $y$; what we really want to know is - as $x$ is getting larger and larger, how does $y$ behave then? It is a dynamical process, not a specific evaluation of the function.

![](figs/the_land.png)

Paraphrased differently, we want to know what happens to $(x,y)$ during the process of making $x$ bigger and bigger? To state that $x$ is getting bigger and bigger, we write $x\longrightarrow \infty$. In such a dynamic case, what happens with the value $y$? Meaning, what is the dynamic solution $y$ of the system:

$$
\begin{equation}\begin{cases}y=y_0+m(x-x_0)\\x\longrightarrow +\infty\end{cases}\end{equation}
$$ {#eq-system_lim}

Lets make an intuitive guess about the solution of this problem (later, when we study limits we'll see a more systematic way to solve these problems), the @fig-lims helps a lot. To understand how the values of $y$ behave when $x$ increases, we have to understand how the calculation $y_0+m(x-x_0)$ behaves, when we keep increasing $x$. A key aspect of it, is that the term $m x$ gets larger and larger while $y_0-mx_0$ remains a constant, eventually, $mx$ is so much larger than this constant (we are increasing $x$ after all) that our original equation $y=y_0+m(x-x_0)$ becomes approximately given by $y\sim mx$. The functions $y_0+m(x-x_0)$ and $mx$ are different! But when $x$ is large they are very similar because the constant $y_0-mx_0$ becomes irrelevant. Now we shift our focus to the approximate equation and try to solve it:

$$
\begin{equation}\begin{cases}y\sim mx\\x\longrightarrow +\infty\end{cases}\end{equation}
$$ {#eq-system_lim_approx}

This is easy, because its just an atomic polynomial. The dynamical solution to this problem is \[ $y$ will increase when $x$ increases\], we write the answer as $y\longrightarrow +\infty$ when $m$ is positive. As a consequence the answer to @eq-system_lim is also $y\longrightarrow +\infty$.

Observe that the function $y\sim mx$ is not equal to $y=y_0+m(x-x_0)$, and thus their graphs are not equal, but when $x$ is very large, they are *similar*, see picture below. Solving @eq-system_lim_approx we automatically get the answer to the problem @eq-system_lim . Both answers are $y\longrightarrow+\infty$.

![Does y grow when x grows?](figs/lims.png){#fig-lims width="453"}

If on the other hand $m$ is negative then, by the same reasoning, $y$ also becomes very negative.

**Awful Exercise:** What happens to $y$ when $x\longrightarrow-\infty$?
