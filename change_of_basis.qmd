We start with a invertible (1-1 and onto) linear function $p$, that maps $\mathbb{V}$ into itself:

$$
\begin{align}p:\mathbb{V}&\longrightarrow \mathbb{V}\\ v&\longmapsto p(v)\end{align}
$$

Choose a basis in $\mathbb{V}$:

$$
\mathbf{B} =\begin{pmatrix}v_1 & v_2 &\dots & v_n\end{pmatrix}
$$

Which, as usual, allow us to give a form to elements of our vector space:

$$
v=\mathbf{B} X\qquad\text{with}\qquad X=\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\x_2\\\vdots\\x_n\end{pmatrix}
$$

Since we do not have an explicit formula for $p$ , nor for the elements of $\mathbb{V}$, the next best thing we can have is to know how the function acts on the basis, that is, what is the matrix $P$ in the following formula:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}p(v_1) & p(v_2) & \cdots & p(v_n)\end{pmatrix}=:p(\mathbf{B})=\mathbf{B}P
$$ {#eq-phiB}

The matrix $P$ is full rank and thus also invertible.

We could, as we did previously, act now with $p$ on any element of $v$, that would return:

$$
p(\mathbf{B}X)=\mathbf{B}PX
$$ {#eq-varphi_map}

thanks to the linearity property of $p$. Since $p(\mathbf{B}X)$ is in $\mathbb{V}$ we can write as some linear combination $\mathbf{B}Y$, substitution on @eq-varphi_map gives us $Y=PX$.

Recall the type of mapping (1-1? Onto?) that $p$ is, we already stated it is invertible, thus, the nullspace and left nullspace of $P$ are zero. Therefore, the function is 1-1 and onto, this properties are important for what follows.

Regarding change of basis, what we are interested is the formula @eq-phiB. Because $p$ is 1-1 and onto, each one of the $n$ vectors in $p(\mathbf{B})$ is distinct and thus, they constitute a new basis for $\mathbb{V}$. Lets make this official by giving it the name:

$$
\mathbf{B}':=p(\mathbf{B})=\mathbf{B}P\qquad\text{and}\qquad \mathbf{B}':=\begin{pmatrix}v_1' & v_2' & \cdots & v_n'\end{pmatrix}
$$ {#eq-change_of_basis_I}

If we read this formula from right to left, we see a map of the basis vectors into new vectors, which we promoted to new prime basis. Reading from left to right we see a decomposition (or expressing) the prime basis vectors in terms of the original (unprimed) basis vectors.

Since $P$ is invertible, we can also write the original (unprimed) basis vectors in terms of the prime vectors:

$$
\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{B}'P^{-1}
$$ {#eq-change_of_basis_II}

## Commentary

The function $p$ defined above transforms one $v$ vector of $\mathbb{V}$ into another vector $p(v)$ of $\mathbb{V}$. Since the underlying space is the same, we can think of $p$ as rotating and rescaling $v$.

The same rotating and rescalling can be observed in $\mathbb{R}^n$, looking back at @eq-varphi_map, its matrix representation maps as follows

$$
Y=PX
$$ {#eq-formula}

where the entries of $X$ and $Y$ are wrt the same basis $\mathbf{B}$ (rather than wrt $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{C}$ just like seen in previous lecture). Implying that $P$ transforms the columns vector $X$ by rotating it and recalling into $Y$. In other words, there is an *active transformation* of the column vector into another different and distinct vector $Y$. The formula @eq-formula tells us how the components (again wrt to $\mathbf{B}$) changed.
:::

@eq-change_of_basis_II provides us with a way to write any vector written in the original basis $\mathbf{B}$ in terms of the new basis $\mathbf{B}'$, how?

Whatever the basis (original or new) we use to express $v$, the vector is still the same element of $\mathbb{V}$, therefore, given $v$, the following equality is assured:

$$
v=\mathbf{B}X=\mathbf{B}'X'
$$ {#eq-same_v}

for some columns vectors $X$ and $X'$, which must be somehow related.

To obtain that relation remember we know @eq-change_of_basis_II, substituting we find:

$$
v=\mathbf{B}'P^{-1}X=\mathbf{B}'X'
$$

Which in turn leads us to the inescapable conclusion that the coordinates $X'$ of $v$ in the new basis can be obtained from the coordinates in the old original basis $X$ as follows:

$$
X'=P^{-1}X
$$ {#eq-passive_I}

which, by the way, also allow us to compute from the new coordinates the original coordinates:

$$
X=PX'
$$ {#eq-passive_II}

The equation @eq-passive_I (or equivalently @eq-passive_II ) relate the $X$ and $X'$ so that @eq-same_v is true.

A key point to note when writing @eq-same_v is that the vector $v$ does not change, there is no rotation or rescaling of the vector. The formulas @eq-passive_I and @eq-passive_II, despite the similarity with @eq-formula, have radical different meaning! The @eq-passive_II, translate from points of view on the vector $v$, justifying the name *passive transformation* (of coordinates), rather than *active transformation*.

## Commentary

-   It should be clear that $X$ and $X'$ are completely distinct vectors, even with different lengths, thus they were rotated and rescaled, but the key point remains, the $v$ is still he same:

$$
v=\mathbf{B}X=\mathbf{B}'X'
$$

-   **Warning:** while $P$ in $\mathbf{B}'=\mathbf{B}P$ maps from original to new basis; in $X=PX'$, the matrix $P$ maps new to original components! The prime order is reversed.

The starting four ingredients:

1.  $f:\mathbb{V}\overset{\sim}{\longrightarrow}\mathbb{W}$, not necessarily invertible.
2.  $p:\mathbb{V}\overset{\sim}{\longrightarrow}\mathbb{V}$ which is invertible.
3.  $q:\mathbb{W}\overset{\sim}{\longrightarrow}\mathbb{W}$ which is also invertible.
4.  A basis $\mathbf{B}\subset\mathbb{V}$ and a basis $\mathbf{C}\subset \mathbb{W}$

With them we cook the following diagram:

![](figs/change_of_basis_in_f.png){width="400"}

Lets do it in steps:

## Step 1:

Define the action of $f$ on any vector $v\in\mathbb{V}$ as usual:

$$
\mathbf{C}Y=:f(v)=\mathbf{C}AX \qquad v=\mathbf{B}X \qquad X=\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\vdots\\ x_n\end{pmatrix} \qquad Y=\begin{pmatrix}y_1\\\vdots\\ y_n\end{pmatrix}
$$

Notice that the column vector $X$ of the components of $v$ wrt $\mathbf{B}$ are mapped into the column vector $Y$ of components of $f(v)$ wrt $\mathbf{B}$ by the action of the matrix $A$.

## Step 2:

Use the endomorphisms $p$ and $q$ to define new (primed) bases for the domain and codomain of $f$:

$$
\mathbf{B}':=p(\mathbf{B})=\mathbf{B}P\qquad \mathbf{C}':=p(\mathbf{C})=\mathbf{C}Q
$$

which mean the components of $X$ of $v$ and the components $Y$ of $w$ wrt the original bases transform as:

$$
X=PX'\qquad Y=QY'
$$

## Step 3:

Substitute the results:

$$
\mathbf{C}'Y'=f(v)=\mathbf{C}'Q^{-1}APX'
$$

which implies, the mapping between components in the new bases of both $\mathbb{V}$ and $\mathbb{W}$ are given by:

$$
Y'=Q^{-1}APX'
$$

This equation tells us something important, just as $A$ maps $X$ into $Y$, the matrix $Q^{-1}AP$ maps $X'$ into $Y'$, in other words, the matrix:

$$
A'=Q^{-1}AP
$$ {#eq-rel_A_A_prime}

play the role of $A$ wrt to the new basis.

If a $v$ is mapped into $f(v)$ by $f$, then from the point of view of $\mathbf{B}$, the matrix $A$ maps $X$ into $Y$, while from the point of view of $\mathbf{B}'$, the matrix $A'$ maps $X?$ into $Y'$; the matrices $A$ and $A'$ are related by @eq-rel_A_A_prime.

These calculations are summarized in the following diagram:
