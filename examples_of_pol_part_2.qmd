# Molecular Polynomials

Combining atomic polynomials through linear combinations we obtain molecular polynomials.

## Recall

A linear combination is an expression where things are multiplied by constants and then added. Here is an example

$$
4x^3+5x+2
$$

The constants $4$, $5$ and $2$ multiply $x^3$, $x^1$ and $x^0$; which are then summed. Notice how $x^0$ is hidden, to find it, remember that $2 =2\times 1$ and $1=x^0$.
