So, for the moment we'll consider a vector, or better said - a column vector - an array of numbers which we write as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\5\\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\-5\\\\0.1\\end{pmatrix},\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\\\z\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nWhat can you do with vectors? *Answer:* linear combinations! A linear combination is a computation that looks like this:\n\n$$\n3 \\mathbf{u}+2\\mathbf{v} = 2\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\3\\end{pmatrix}+4\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\-1\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nFirst multiply the vectors by the scalars, then add the vectors by adding the entries, the result is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\6\\end{pmatrix}+\\begin{pmatrix} 4\\\\-4\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 6\\\\2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nA generic linear combination looks like this:\n\n$$\na \\mathbf{u}+b\\mathbf{v} = a\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\5\\end{pmatrix}+b\\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\10\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}a +2b\\\\5a +10b \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are scalars.\n\nIf you know how to combine two vectors, you know how to combine three and so on.\n\nThe geometrical addition of vectors is performed using the paralelogram rule:\n\n![](figs/adding_vectors_geo.png){width=\"360\"}\n\n# Vector spaces and Subspaces\n\nThe operation of linear combination allow us to construct vector spaces. Here are some examples:\n\n-   **Example One:** Consider the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}$, this is our starting point. Now imagine multiplying it by every possible scalar; the end result is a set of vectors which lie along the same line:\n\n    ![](figs/subspace_is_a_line.png){width=\"243\"}\n\n    This set of vectors has a special property: any linear combinations of its vectors yields another vector in the set, in particular if you multiply the vector by zero, we get the origin. Because of this, we call this set a vector space.\n\n    Note that: the same line (vector space) results if you consider the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\4\\end{pmatrix}$ or any other from the set.\n\n    Additionally, since the line is a subset of vectors of the entire plane, we call this a subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n    This is also an example you found from high-school, recall that a the set of vectors $c\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}$ spans a line that passes through the origin, it is the line whose equation is $y=2x$.\n\n    ::: callout-note\n    ## Commentary\n\n    Multiplying a vector by a scalar is just a particular example of a linear combination:\n\n    $$\n    a\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}+b\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    :::\n\n-   **Example Two:** Consider the vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 3\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$. Now multiply both by every possible scalar and then them; the end result is again a set of vectors. All these vectors lie in a two dimensional plane $\\mathbf{R}^2$:\n\n    ![](figs/R2_plane.png){width=\"318\"}\n\n    From the picture, it is easy to convince yourself that any linear combination of two vectors of the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is another vector in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. More, notice the same space comes about if we consider $\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$, or any other two pair of vectors that point in distinct directions.\n\n-   **Example Three:** Consider the vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$. Linear combine them with every scalar and you obtain a set of vectors. All these vectors fill the three dimensional space $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n    ![](figs/R3_space.png){width=\"468\"}\n\n-   **Example Four:** Consider the vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}$ , $\\begin{pmatrix} 3\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$. All linear combinations of these three vectors always yield a vector in $\\mathbf{R}^2$, a two-dimensional vector space and not three-dimensional!\n\n    ![](figs/three_vectors_R2.png){width=\"201\"}\n\n    Notice one of the three vectors is redundant.\n\n-   **Example Five:** Consider the vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$. All linear combination do NOT generate the entire three dimensional space, they generate a subspace of two dimensions, the plane in the following picture.\n\n    ![](figs/subspace_in_R3.png){width=\"426\"}\n\n    Again, recall from high-school that a plane with equation $-x+1/2y=0$ contains the origin and is perpendicular to the vector $(-1,1/2,0)$. This plane is the vector space:\n\n    ![](figs/subspace_in_R3_and_normal.png){width=\"440\"}\n\nThere are many examples that can be provided but I feel these suffice for you to understand some key points:\n\n1.  Having a mental picture of the process of linear combining vectors is key to understand whether it results in a line, a plane or three dimensional space.\n2.  The kind of resulting space (line, plane, three-space) depends on the vectors we decide to combine. But how? We will see in next section.\n3.  In all these examples, the resulting set contains a very special vector, the $\\mathbf{0}$, vector at the origin - just choose your scalars as zero.\n4.  The vectors we consider at the beginning of each example are just one example of many other possible choices we could have made to generate that space.\n\nAll these linear combinations result in a set of vectors, but this set has a very important property: any linear combination of its vectors (I mean any!) yields another vector in the set. Please note, the $\\mathbf{0}$ vector must always belong to a vector space! And thus we define (like in a dictionary)\n\n*\\[vector space\\] = \\[a set, an operation (linear combination) plus this fact above\\]*\n\n# Linear dependence and independence\n\nFirst lets see what it is, then how to check it. As we will see throughout the course there are many ways of doing it.\n\nThis is seen best with examples.\n\n-   **Example 1:** Just consider two parallel vectors\n\n    ![](figs/two_parallel_vectors.png){width=\"169\"}\n\n    One is just twice the other. They are dependent because you can create one from the other:\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\4\\end{pmatrix} = 2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix} \\qquad\\text{or}\\qquad \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\4\\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n-   **Example 2:** More difficult. Consider again the vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}$ , $\\begin{pmatrix} 3\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\3\\end{pmatrix}$. If you discard the first vector, nothing is lost because through the linear combination of the second and third vectors we can recover it. Here is how:\n\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{3}\\begin{pmatrix} 3\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}+\\frac{2}{3}\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\3\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n    In other words the first vector depends on the second and third vector through the linear combination above, it can be fully build from these pieces and thus it does not bring anything new.\n\n    ![](figs/three_vectors_R2.png){width=\"230\"}\n\n    What may not be so obvious is the fact that any vector from the three could be discarded, for example drop the second one! No problem the first and third vectors can construct it:\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}-\\frac{2}{3}\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\3\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\nFor simple examples: If you can see visually what kind of vector space a given list of vectors gives to us, then you can also see whether there are superfluous or not. For more complex situations we need special techniques, but right now all I want for you to get the idea:\n\n*Vectors from a list are linearly independent if you cannot construct any one of them from the remaining ones.*\n\nand also how it can be paraphrased differently:\n\n*Vectors from a list are linearly independent when there exist scalars that when combine them yield the zero vector. Otherwise they are dependent.*\n\nWe can already see this paraphrasing in the examples above, just rewrite the equations as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n&\\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\4\\end{pmatrix} - 2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n&\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}+2\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\\\\\n&\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}-2\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix} =\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align}\\\\\n$$\n\nIt indeed shows that there exist scalars that combine the given vectors into the zero vector. Therefore saying that one vector of the list can be generated by the others.\n\n# Systems of equations\n\nLets review the method you use in high-school to solve systems of equations - the elimination method - and then rewrite it under a new notation - the matrix and vector notation.\n\nA few examples will be given.\n\n## Matrix-vector notation for a system\n\nConsider the system with two equations, called $l_1$ and $l_2$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx-4y =2\\\\\n2x-6y = 5\n\\end{cases}\n$$ {#eq-sist}\n\nIn @eq-sist we find two equations and two unknowns $x$ and $y$. We want their values such that both equations are satisfied.\n\nUsing the matrix-vector notation we can write @eq-sist as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4\\\\ 2 & -6 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\5\\end{pmatrix}\n$$ {#eq-matrix_sist}\n\nLets read @eq-matrix_sist in words: the $2$ by $2$ matrix of coefficients is multiplied by the column vector $\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}$ , the result is $\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\5\\end{pmatrix}$. This is one equation, and the unknown is the column vector $\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nHow do we multiply a vector by a matrix?\n\n*Answer:*\n\n$$\n\\overbrace{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4\\\\ 2 & -6 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}}^\\text{matrix-vector mult.} =\\overbrace{\\begin{pmatrix}1\\cdot x-4\\cdot y \\\\ 2\\cdot x-6\\cdot y\\end{pmatrix}}^\\text{scalar mult.}\n$$\n\nMatrix times a vector on the lhs is just a super-compact way of writing the vector on the rhs. Moreover, notice the shapes of the matrix and vectors, this is very, very important. A $2$ by $2$ matrix times a $2$ by $1$ column vector yields a $2$ by $1$ column vector! If you understand this it should not be a problem to see what shapes are or not compatible, check this:\n\n-   \\[$2\\times2$\\]\\[ $3\\times 1$\\] $=$ Nonsense\n\n-   \\[$3\\times2$\\]\\[ $2\\times 1$\\] $=$ \\[$3\\times 1$\\]\n\n-   \\[$2\\times3$\\]\\[ $3\\times 1$\\] $=$ \\[$2\\times 1$\\]\n\n-   \\[$3\\times2$\\]\\[ $3\\times 1$\\] $=$ Nonsense\n\n-   \\[$1\\times3$\\]\\[ $3\\times 1$\\] $=$ \\[$1\\times 1$\\]\n\n## Solving the system using the Elimination method\n\nLets solve the system @eq-sist using the traditional rules we already know from high-school, recall:\n\n1.  you can replace an equation by itself times some constant.\n2.  you can replace any one equation by the sum both equations.\n3.  you can isolate $x$ or $y$ in one equation and substitute in the other equation.\n\nIn other words, 1. and 2., just say this: you can replace $l_1$ or $l_2$ by some convenient combination $al_1+bl_2$.\n\nThe central idea of the Elimination method is use combination of equations to eliminate variables and thus giving us an *equivalent* and *easier to solve* system. To eliminate variables we use clever use of rules $1$ and $2$. Once the system is simple enough we can use rule $3$. How do you know what is or not a good combination? Just practice and see.\n\nThis recaps what you know, now lets use these rules to solve the @eq-sist and in parallel see the corresponding matrix-vector version.\n\n-   **step 1:** Replace equation $l_2$ by, $l_2$ minus twice the equation $l_1$, i.e., make the new second equation $l_2'$ into $l_2-2l_1$. This gives us:\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{cases}x-4y =2\\\\2x-6y = 5\\end{cases} \\overset{l_2'=l_2-2l_1}{\\longrightarrow}\\begin{cases} x-4y =2\\\\ 2y = 1\\end{cases}\n    $$\n\n    Correspondingly we subtract from row $l_2$ twice the row $l_1$ in @eq-matrix_sist, giving us\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4\\\\ 2 & -6 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\5\\end{pmatrix}\\overset{l_2'=l_2-2l_1}{\\longrightarrow} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4\\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n-   **step 2:** Multiply equation $l_2$ by $1/2$:\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{cases} x-4y =2\\\\ 2y = 1\\end{cases}\\overset{l_2'=1/2l_2}{\\longrightarrow} \\begin{cases} x-4y =2\\\\ y = 1/2\\end{cases}\n    $$\n\n    In matrix-vector notation we find:\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4\\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}\\overset{l_2'=1/2l_2}{\\longrightarrow} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\1/2\\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n-   **step 3:** Since the system is simple enough, there are two way to go at this stage. You either substitute the equation $y=1/2$ into the first equation $x-4y=2$ and solve for $x$, this gives us the answer $x=4$ and $y=1/2$. The second way to to go about it, is to simplify even further the system of equations, we do that by replacing $l_1$ by, $l_1$ plus four times $l_2$:\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{cases} x-4y =2\\\\ y = 1/2\\end{cases}\\overset{l_1'=l_1+4l_2}{\\longrightarrow}\\begin{cases} x =4\\\\ y = 1/2\\end{cases}\n    $$\n\n    In matrix-vector notation we find:\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\1/2\\end{pmatrix}\\overset{l_1'=l_1+4l_2}{\\longrightarrow} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix}4\\\\1/2\\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n    From which we can read the final result $x=4$ and $y=1/2$.\n\nGoing through the three steps again we notice we can improve our matrix-vector notation by suppressing from it the column $\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}$ and writing instead the steps as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4 &\\bigm| & 2 \\\\ 2 & -6 &| & 5 \\end{pmatrix}\\overset{l_2'=l_2-2l_1}{\\longrightarrow} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4 &\\bigm| & 2\\\\ 0 & 2 &\\bigm| & 1\\end{pmatrix} \\overset{l_2'=1/2l_2}{\\longrightarrow} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4 &\\bigm| & 2\\\\ 0 & 1 &\\bigm| & 1/2\\end{pmatrix}\\overset{l_1'=l_1+4l_2}{\\longrightarrow} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 &\\bigm| & 4\\\\ 0 & 1 &\\bigm| & 1/2\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nFrom now on we'll adopt this way of writing systems of equations, its called the extended matrix notation, because we appended a new column to right side of the $2\\times2$ matrix. From the extended matrix we read the solution as follows\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 &\\bigm| & 4\\\\ 0 & 1 &\\bigm| & 1/2\\end{pmatrix}\\longrightarrow \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix}4\\\\1/2\\end{pmatrix}\\longrightarrow \\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix}4\\\\1/2\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nwhere in the last step we multiplied the vector by the matrix.\n\nThe vector\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}4\\\\1/2\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nis the solution of\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4\\\\ 2 & -6 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\5\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nMeaning, the solution of\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}x-4y =2\\\\2x-6y = 5\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nis:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}x =4\\\\y=1/2\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n## More examples of the elimination method\n\nThe following examples will be given:\n\n-   A system with one solution\n\n-   A system with no solution\n\n-   A system with many solutions\n\n-   Another system with many solutions\n\n### Example 1: A system with one solution\n\nConsider the system, which we write in three different notations.\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx+y-z=1\\\\\n2x-y+2z = 9\\\\\n2y=-x+z\n\\end{cases}\n\\leftrightsquigarrow\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & -1\\\\\n2 & -1 & 2\\\\\n1 & 2 &-1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx\\\\\ny\\\\\nz\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1\\\\\n9\\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\leftrightsquigarrow\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & -1 &\\bigm| & 1\\\\\n2 & -1 & 2 &\\bigm| & 9\\\\\n1 & 2 & -1 &\\bigm| & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$ {#eq-impossible_1}\n\nAgain we'll use the later notation during the elimination algorithm, because we don't have to carry around the $x$, $y$ and $z$ at each step.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n&\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & -1 &\\bigm| & 1\\\\2 & -1 & 2 &\\bigm| & 9\\\\1 & 2 & -1 &\\bigm| & 0\\end{pmatrix} \n\\overset{l_2'=l_2-2l_1\\\\l_3'=l_3-l_1}{\\longrightarrow}\n\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & -1 &\\bigm| & 1\\\\0 & -3 & 4 &\\bigm| & 7\\\\0 & 1 & 0 &\\bigm| & -1\\end{pmatrix} \n\\overset{l_2 \\leftrightarrow l_3}{\\longrightarrow}\n\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & -1 &\\bigm| & 1\\\\0 & 1 & 0 &\\bigm| & -1\\\\0 & -3 & 4 &\\bigm| & 7\\end{pmatrix}\\\\\n\\overset{l_3'=l_3+3l_2}{\\longrightarrow}\n&\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & -1 &\\bigm| & 1\\\\0 & 1 & 0 &\\bigm| & -1\\\\0 & 0 & 4 &\\bigm| & 4\\end{pmatrix} \n\\overset{l_3'=1/4l_3}{\\longrightarrow}\n\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & -1 &\\bigm| & 1\\\\0 & 1 & 0 &\\bigm| & -1\\\\0 & 0 & 1 &\\bigm| & 1\\end{pmatrix} \n\\overset{l_1'=l_1+l_3}{\\longrightarrow}\n\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & 0 &\\bigm| & 2\\\\0 & 1 & 0 &\\bigm| & -1\\\\0 & 0 & 1 &\\bigm| & 1\\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n\\overset{l_1'=l_1-l_2}{\\longrightarrow}\n&\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 &\\bigm| & 2\\\\0 & 1 & 0 &\\bigm| & -1\\\\0 & 0 & 1 &\\bigm| & 1\\end{pmatrix} \n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nMost of the system simplification (by elimination of variables) is done in this matrix-vector notation, looking at we find we went as far as we can, thus it is time to go back to the original notation - we find:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx = 3\\\\y=-1\\\\z=1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhich is the solution of the system of equations!

There's an infinite number of them.\n\n# Analysis of a system of equations\n\nHow many solutions are there?\n\nAs a result of the using the elimination algorithm one of three scenarios will unfold:\n\n-   There is just one solution\n\n-   There is no solution\n\n-   There is more than one solution. In which case, how many?\n\nImagine we have a system of equations before us - equivalently a matrix $A$ and a $\\mathbf{b}$ vector or equivalently an extended matrix. Whether we have one, none or many solution has to do with the coefficients of the system - equivalently it has to do with the choice of $A$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ or equivalently, it has to do with the entries of the extended matrix.\n\nOne way to answer the question is to solve the system and count how many solutions we find, elimination is a tool to do that.\n\nThe matrix-vector and then the extended matrix notation as just a new aesthetic for an actual system of equations. An aesthetic that made easier the use of the elimination algorithm, because it just focus on the coefficients; when the system is simple enough we went back to the system notation, to easily solve it.\n\nWhat we are going to do now is to give a deeper meaning to this notation, which in turn will make you see why some $A$'s together with $b$'s give one, none or many solutions. The matrix-vector notation or equivalently the extended matrix notation are like looking at an object, in this case a system of equation, from a different angle.\n\nBefore elaborating on what this deeper view is, we need some preparation, specifically we need to introduce the concepts:\n\n-   Matrix Multiplication and linear combination of rows\n\n-   Inverse Matrix\n\n-   Pivots and rank of a matrix\n\n-   Two special Subspaces: Column space and Nullspace\n\nWe'll focus on Example 4.\n\n## Matrix multiplication and linear combination of rows\n\nThe first step in @eq-example_4_system is\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 2 & 2\\\\2 & 4 & 6 & 8\\\\3 & 6 & 8 & 10 \\end{pmatrix}\\overset{l_2' = l_2-2l_1}{\\longrightarrow}\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\0 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\\\3 & 6 & 8 & 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1\\\\2\\\\3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\overset{l_2' = l_2-2l_1}{\\longrightarrow}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1\\\\0\\\\3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nImplicit was the following matrix multiplication:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 \\\\-2 & 1 & 0 \\\\0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\2 & 4 & 6 & 8 \\\\3 & 6 & 8 & 10\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\0 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\\\3 & 6 & 8 & 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 \\\\-2 & 1 & 0 \\\\0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\2\\\\3\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\3\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nHow do we do these calculations?\n\nThe general rule is:\n\n![Matrix multiplication of a 3x4 matrix by a 3x3 matrix.](figs/matrix_mult.png){#fig-mm width=\"523\"}\n\nwhere, for example:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\na_{22}'= e_{21}a_{12} + e_{22}a_{22} +e_{23}a_{32}\\\\\na_{23}'= e_{21}a_{13} + e_{22}a_{23} +e_{23}a_{33}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$ {#eq-ex_of_mm}\n\nLets name the matrices involved, the $e$'s matrix is called $E_1$ and the $a$'s matrix is called $A$, the result of the multiplication is called $A'$.\n\nObserving @fig-mm and @eq-ex_of_mm we see two important aspects about $E_1 A$\n\n1.  The shape of $E_1$ is $3\\times3$,the shape of $A$ is $3\\times 4$ and the shape of $A'$ is $3\\times4$.\n\n2.  The matrix $E_1$ needs to have as many columns as there are rows in $A$ (in this case $3$), otherwise it is not possible to do matrix multiplication. In other words, the compatible shapes for matrix multiplication are of the form $[m\\times r][r\\times n] = [m\\times n]$, for any integers $m,n,r$. For example, the case above is $[3\\times 3][3\\times 4]$ and thus $m=3$, $r=3$ and $n=4$.\n\n3.  The general formula for the entries of $A'$ is the complicated formula:\n\n    $$\n    a_{ij}'=\\sum_{k=1}^re_{ik}a_{kj}\n    $$\n\n## Inverse Matrix\n\nOnly square matrices can have inverses.\n\nNot every square matrix will have an inverse. For example $E_1$ is square, thus it may or not have an inverse $E_1^{-1}$, on the other hand the matrix $A$ is rectangular, thus no inverse exists.\n\nHow do we compute an inverse of a matrix?\n\nThe $E$'s matrices have inverses, always and thus:\n\n$$\nAx=b \\iff EAx=Eb \\iff A'x=b'\n$$\n\nare equivalent and and as a result their truth sets are equal! Finding the truth set of the later is easier than the former.\n\n## Two special subspaces\n\nHere we focus on the column space and nullspace of a matrix.\n\nThe column space is the vector space that is generated by taking all linear combinations of the columns of a matrix. For example, the column space of the matrix\n\n$$\nA=\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\2 & 4 & 6 & 8 \\\\3 & 6 & 8 & 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$ {#eq-the_matrix_A}\n\nfrom example 4 called $C(A)$ and is generated by\n\n$$\na\\begin{pmatrix}\n1\\\\2\\\\3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n+\nb\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\4\\\\6\\end{pmatrix}\n+\nc\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\6\\\\8\\end{pmatrix}\n+\nd\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\8\\\\10\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nIt may happen, and it is the case as we shall see, that we need not all the columns of $A$ to generate $C(A)$, the reason being, some of the column vectors may depend on other columns, thus not providing no additional information. At any rate, $C(A)$ always comes as a result of combining all the columns, it is just that some columns are redundant and we can generate the same with less.\n\nThe nullspace of a matrix, take again @eq-the_matrix_A, is the vector space generated by all solutions $\\mathbf{x}_N$ of the equation:\n\n$$\nA\\mathbf{x}_N=\\mathbf{0}\n$$\n\nThe concept of column space and nullspace will be key from now on.\n\n![](figs/plan.png){width=\"390\"}\n\n## Systems of equations from a new view\n\nThe system of equations used in example 4 is:\n\n$$\nA\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\n\\leftrightsquigarrow\n\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\2 & 4 & 6 & 8 \\\\3 & 6 & 8 & 10 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\\\z\\\\w\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\2\\\\3\\end{pmatrix}\n\\leftrightsquigarrow\n\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 2 & 2 &\\bigm|1\\\\2 & 4 & 6 & 8 &\\bigm|2\\\\3 & 6 & 8 & 10 &\\bigm| 3\\end{pmatrix}\n$$ {#eq-Axb_two_ways}\n\nWe can rewrite the system of equation in, yet, another manner:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\2\\\\3\\end{pmatrix}x+\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\4\\\\6\\end{pmatrix}y+\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\6\\\\8\\end{pmatrix}z+\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\8\\\\10\\end{pmatrix}w = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\2\\\\3\\end{pmatrix}\n$$ {#eq-Axb_lc}\n\nIn other words, a matrix times a column vector is a linear combination of the columns of the matrix. Under the @eq-Axb_two_ways we would ask, what is the column vector $\\mathbf{x}$ which when multiplied by the matrix $A$ yields the column vector $\\mathbf{b}$.\n\nUnder the @eq-Axb_lc we would ask: what is the linear combination of the columns that leads to the vector $\\mathbf{b}$ on the rhs. But now note: this combination is only possible, provided the $\\mathbf{b}$ vector is in the column space!\n\nThis crucial observation can be paraphrased differently; going back to @eq-Axb_two_ways, focus on the extended matrix version of the system of the equations and note, that, when we extend the matrix, i.e., when we append the $\\mathbf{b}$ vector on the rhs, the column space must not change, for otherwise the $\\mathbf{b}$ was not in the column space.\n\nMoreover, one more way, to paraphrase the paragraph above, the $\\mathbf{b}$ vector must be dependent on the columns of $A$.\n\n## Putting all together\n\nBecause the $E_k$ matrices are invertible we have the following equivalence:\n\n$A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b} \\iff A'\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}'$\n\nAnd thus the solutions of both equations are the same, in particular, following example 4 we have (using the extended-matrix notation) $$\n\\begin{align}\n&\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 2 & 2 &\\bigm|1\\\\\n2 & 4 & 6 & 8 &\\bigm|2\\\\\n3 & 6 & 8 & 10 &\\bigm| 3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\iff\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 0 & -2 &\\bigm| 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 2 &\\bigm| 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &\\bigm| 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nWe can rewrite both sides of the equivalence as the follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n&\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\2\\\\3\\end{pmatrix}x+\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\4\\\\6\\end{pmatrix}y+\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\6\\\\8\\end{pmatrix}z+\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\8\\\\10\\end{pmatrix}w = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\2\\\\3\\end{pmatrix}\\\\\n&\\iff\n\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}x+\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}y+\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}z+\\begin{pmatrix}-2\\\\2\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}w = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align}\n$$ {#eq-complex-simple}\n\nWhat this says, is that the coefficients that combine the columns of $A$ to give us the $\\mathbf{b}$ is exactly the same as the coefficients that, when combine the columns of $A'$ give us the vector $\\mathbf{b}'$.\n\nWe already know how to find the solution for this problem, see Section, what we want to do now to find the solution using the matrix-vector notation. The way you do it in this notation, provides you with deeper insight about when there is one, none or many solutions.\n\nHow would we find $x,y,z,w$ that satisfy the equations above?\n\n1.  Simplify the system as much as you can, we already did this. The lhs of @eq-complex-simple is complicated, but the rhs (full of zeros and many ones) is simple.\n\n2.  Identify the dependent and independent columns of the simple matrix. We do this by visual inspection:\n\n    The first and third columns can be linearly combined to generate the second and fourth columns:\n\n    $$\n    \\text{col}_2 =2\\text{col}_1\\qquad \\text{col}_4=2\\text{col}_3-2\\text{col}_1\n    $$\n\n    Notice the independent columns have an entry $1$ and the remaining entries are zeros, the independent columns are also called the pivot columns. The dependent columns are called free columns.\n\n    The $y$ and $w$ unknowns are the free unknowns.\n\n3.  To find a particular solution of the system, set the free unknowns to zero:\n\n    $$\n    y=0\\qquad w=0\n    $$\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}x\n    +\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}0\n    +\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}z\n    +\\begin{pmatrix}-2\\\\2\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}0 = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n4.  Now find $x$ and $z$, by inspection:\n\n    $$\n    x=1 \\qquad z=0\n    $$\n\n5.  The particular solution is\n\n    $$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\0\\\\0\\\\0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n6.  To find the general solution, compute the nullspace by solving $A'\\mathbf{x}_N=\\mathbf{0}$ and add it to the particular solution\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}x_N+\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}y_N\n    +\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}z_N+\\begin{pmatrix}-2\\\\2\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}w_N = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\n    $$ {#eq-nullspace_eq}\n\n    Reminding ourselves which columns are independent and which ones are dependent tells us how to find the solution. The column two and four can be built out from approriate linear combinations of column one and three.\n\n    To solve the equation we choose the free variables $y_N$ and $w_N$ as we wish and then solve for the $x_N$ and $z_N$. When choosing freely, at least choose something that simplify you calculations, for example set $y_N=1$ and $w_N=0$ in @eq-nullspace_eq and guess what is $x_N$ and $z;_N$ we get:\n\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{x}_N =\\begin{pmatrix}-2\\\\1\\\\0\\\\0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n    Now substitute $y_N=0$ and $w_N=1$ into @eq-nullspace_eq and guess the corresponding $x_N$ and $z_N$; the answer gives us:\n\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{x}_N=\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\0\\\\-2\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n    The nullspace of the matrix $A$ is composed by all linear combinations:\n\n    $$\n    a\\begin{pmatrix}-2\\\\1\\\\0\\\\0 \\end{pmatrix} +b\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\0\\\\-2\\\\1 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n7.  So far we know a particular solution for the problem $A\\mathbf{x}_p=\\mathbf{b}$ and we know the nullspace of $A$, the key observations is this:\n\n    If $\\mathbf{x}_P$ is a particular solution of $A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}$ then adding to it any $\\mathbf{x}_N$ will not make a difference.\n\n    Justification: $A(\\mathbf{x}_P+\\mathbf{x}_N)=A\\mathbf{x}_P+A\\mathbf{x}_N=\\mathbf{b}+\\mathbf{0}=\\mathbf{b}$\n\n    Thus, the system $A\\mathbf{x} =\\mathbf{b}$ has an infinite number of solutions, all of the form $\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{x}_P+\\mathbf{x}_N$.\n\n    For the matrix in question, the solutions are these:\n\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{x}=\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}+a\\begin{pmatrix}-2\\\\1\\\\0\\\\0 \\end{pmatrix} +b\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\0\\\\-2\\\\1 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$ {#eq-sol_2}\n\nIts important to compare the solutions @eq-sol_1 and @eq-sol_2.\n\nRearranging @eq-sol_1 we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}x &=1-2y&-&2w\\\\z &=&-&2w\\end{cases} \n\\iff\n\\begin{cases}\nx &= &1&+& &-&2a&+& &-&2b\\\\\ny &= & &+& &+&a&+& &+& \\\\\nz &= & &+& &+& &+& &-&2b\\\\\nw &= & &+& &+& &+& &+&b\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe rhs of this equivalence is exactly what @eq-sol_2 means!\n\n## One, none or many solutions?\n\nWith the above discussion understood we have the following cases:\n\n### Case: One solution\n\nWhen the matrix is square and when its *rref* is the identity, then there is only one solution!\n\nExample:\n\n![](figs/one_solution.png){width=\"292\"}\n\nThe solution of this example is $\\mathbf{x} =(3,-1,1)^T$.

So, for the moment we'll consider a vector, or better said - a column vector - an array of numbers which we write as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\5\\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\-5\\\\0.1\\end{pmatrix},\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\\\z\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nWhat can you do with vectors? *Answer:* linear combinations! A linear combination is a computation that looks like this:\n\n$$\n3 \\mathbf{u}+2\\mathbf{v} = 2\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\3\\end{pmatrix}+4\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\-1\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nFirst multiply the vectors by the scalars, then add the vectors by adding the entries, the result is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\6\\end{pmatrix}+\\begin{pmatrix} 4\\\\-4\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 6\\\\2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nA generic linear combination looks like this:\n\n$$\na \\mathbf{u}+b\\mathbf{v} = a\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\5\\end{pmatrix}+b\\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\10\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}a +2b\\\\5a +10b \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are scalars.\n\nIf you know how to combine two vectors, you know how to combine three and so on.\n\nThe geometrical addition of vectors is performed using the paralelogram rule:\n\n![](figs/adding_vectors_geo.png){width=\"360\"}\n\n# Vector spaces and Subspaces\n\nThe operation of linear combination allow us to construct vector spaces. Here are some examples:\n\n-   **Example One:** Consider the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}$, this is our starting point. Now imagine multiplying it by every possible scalar; the end result is a set of vectors which lie along the same line:\n\n    ![](figs/subspace_is_a_line.png){width=\"243\"}\n\n    This set of vectors has a special property: any linear combinations of its vectors yields another vector in the set, in particular if you multiply the vector by zero, we get the origin. Because of this, we call this set a vector space.\n\n    Note that: the same line (vector space) results if you consider the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\4\\end{pmatrix}$ or any other from the set.\n\n    Additionally, since the line is a subset of vectors of the entire plane, we call this a subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n    This is also an example you found from high-school, recall that a the set of vectors $c\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}$ spans a line that passes through the origin, it is the line whose equation is $y=2x$.\n\n    ::: callout-note\n    ## Commentary\n\n    Multiplying a vector by a scalar is just a particular example of a linear combination:\n\n    $$\n    a\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}+b\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    :::\n\n-   **Example Two:** Consider the vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 3\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$. Now multiply both by every possible scalar and then them; the end result is again a set of vectors. All these vectors lie in a two dimensional plane $\\mathbf{R}^2$:\n\n    ![](figs/R2_plane.png){width=\"318\"}\n\n    From the picture, it is easy to convince yourself that any linear combination of two vectors of the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is another vector in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. More, notice the same space comes about if we consider $\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$, or any other two pair of vectors that point in distinct directions.\n\n-   **Example Three:** Consider the vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$. Linear combine them with every scalar and you obtain a set of vectors. All these vectors fill the three dimensional space $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n    ![](figs/R3_space.png){width=\"468\"}\n\n-   **Example Four:** Consider the vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}$ , $\\begin{pmatrix} 3\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$. All linear combinations of these three vectors always yield a vector in $\\mathbf{R}^2$, a two-dimensional vector space and not three-dimensional!\n\n    ![](figs/three_vectors_R2.png){width=\"201\"}\n\n    Notice one of the three vectors is redundant.\n\n-   **Example Five:** Consider the vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$. All linear combination do NOT generate the entire three dimensional space, they generate a subspace of two dimensions, the plane in the following picture.\n\n    ![](figs/subspace_in_R3.png){width=\"426\"}\n\n    Again, recall from high-school that a plane with equation $-x+1/2y=0$ contains the origin and is perpendicular to the vector $(-1,1/2,0)$. This plane is the vector space:\n\n    ![](figs/subspace_in_R3_and_normal.png){width=\"440\"}\n\nThere are many examples that can be provided but I feel these suffice for you to understand some key points:\n\n1.  Having a mental picture of the process of linear combining vectors is key to understand whether it results in a line, a plane or three dimensional space.\n2.  The kind of resulting space (line, plane, three-space) depends on the vectors we decide to combine. But how? We will see in next section.\n3.  In all these examples, the resulting set contains a very special vector, the $\\mathbf{0}$, vector at the origin - just choose your scalars as zero.\n4.  The vectors we consider at the beginning of each example are just one example of many other possible choices we could have made to generate that space.\n\nAll these linear combinations result in a set of vectors, but this set has a very important property: any linear combination of its vectors (I mean any!) yields another vector in the set. Please note, the $\\mathbf{0}$ vector must always belong to a vector space! And thus we define (like in a dictionary)\n\n*\\[vector space\\] = \\[a set, an operation (linear combination) plus this fact above\\]*\n\n# Linear dependence and independence\n\nFirst lets see what it is, then how to check it. As we will see throughout the course there are many ways of doing it.\n\nThis is seen best with examples.\n\n-   **Example 1:** Just consider two parallel vectors\n\n    ![](figs/two_parallel_vectors.png){width=\"169\"}\n\n    One is just twice the other. They are dependent because you can create one from the other:\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\4\\end{pmatrix} = 2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix} \\qquad\\text{or}\\qquad \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\4\\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n-   **Example 2:** More difficult. Consider again the vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}$ , $\\begin{pmatrix} 3\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\3\\end{pmatrix}$. If you discard the first vector, nothing is lost because through the linear combination of the second and third vectors we can recover it. Here is how:\n\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{3}\\begin{pmatrix} 3\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}+\\frac{2}{3}\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\3\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n    In other words the first vector depends on the second and third vector through the linear combination above, it can be fully build from these pieces and thus it does not bring anything new.\n\n    ![](figs/three_vectors_R2.png){width=\"230\"}\n\n    What may not be so obvious is the fact that any vector from the three could be discarded, for example drop the second one! No problem the first and third vectors can construct it:\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}-\\frac{2}{3}\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\3\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\nFor simple examples: If you can see visually what kind of vector space a given list of vectors gives to us, then you can also see whether there are superfluous or not. For more complex situations we need special techniques, but right now all I want for you to get the idea:\n\n*Vectors from a list are linearly independent if you cannot construct any one of them from the remaining ones.*\n\nand also how it can be paraphrased differently:\n\n*Vectors from a list are linearly independent when there exist scalars that when combine them yield the zero vector. Otherwise they are dependent.*\n\nWe can already see this paraphrasing in the examples above, just rewrite the equations as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n&\\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\4\\end{pmatrix} - 2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n&\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}+2\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\\\\\n&\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}-2\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix} =\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align}\\\\\n$$\n\nIt indeed shows that there exist scalars that combine the given vectors into the zero vector. Therefore saying that one vector of the list can be generated by the others.\n\n# Systems of equations\n\nLets review the method you use in high-school to solve systems of equations - the elimination method - and then rewrite it under a new notation - the matrix and vector notation.\n\nA few examples will be given.\n\n## Matrix-vector notation for a system\n\nConsider the system with two equations, called $l_1$ and $l_2$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx-4y =2\\\\\n2x-6y = 5\n\\end{cases}\n$$ {#eq-sist}\n\nIn @eq-sist we find two equations and two unknowns $x$ and $y$. We want their values such that both equations are satisfied.\n\nUsing the matrix-vector notation we can write @eq-sist as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4\\\\ 2 & -6 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\5\\end{pmatrix}\n$$ {#eq-matrix_sist}\n\nLets read @eq-matrix_sist in words: the $2$ by $2$ matrix of coefficients is multiplied by the column vector $\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}$ , the result is $\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\5\\end{pmatrix}$. This is one equation, and the unknown is the column vector $\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nHow do we multiply a vector by a matrix?\n\n*Answer:*\n\n$$\n\\overbrace{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4\\\\ 2 & -6 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}}^\\text{matrix-vector mult.} =\\overbrace{\\begin{pmatrix}1\\cdot x-4\\cdot y \\\\ 2\\cdot x-6\\cdot y\\end{pmatrix}}^\\text{scalar mult.}\n$$\n\nMatrix times a vector on the lhs is just a super-compact way of writing the vector on the rhs. Moreover, notice the shapes of the matrix and vectors, this is very, very important. A $2$ by $2$ matrix times a $2$ by $1$ column vector yields a $2$ by $1$ column vector! If you understand this it should not be a problem to see what shapes are or not compatible, check this:\n\n-   \\[$2\\times2$\\]\\[ $3\\times 1$\\] $=$ Nonsense\n\n-   \\[$3\\times2$\\]\\[ $2\\times 1$\\] $=$ \\[$3\\times 1$\\]\n\n-   \\[$2\\times3$\\]\\[ $3\\times 1$\\] $=$ \\[$2\\times 1$\\]\n\n-   \\[$3\\times2$\\]\\[ $3\\times 1$\\] $=$ Nonsense\n\n-   \\[$1\\times3$\\]\\[ $3\\times 1$\\] $=$ \\[$1\\times 1$\\]\n\n## Solving the system using the Elimination method\n\nLets solve the system @eq-sist using the traditional rules we already know from high-school, recall:\n\n1.  you can replace an equation by itself times some constant.\n2.  you can replace any one equation by the sum both equations.\n3.  you can isolate $x$ or $y$ in one equation and substitute in the other equation.\n\nIn other words, 1. and 2., just say this: you can replace $l_1$ or $l_2$ by some convenient combination $al_1+bl_2$.\n\nThe central idea of the Elimination method is use combination of equations to eliminate variables and thus giving us an *equivalent* and *easier to solve* system. To eliminate variables we use clever use of rules $1$ and $2$. Once the system is simple enough we can use rule $3$. How do you know what is or not a good combination? Just practice and see.\n\nThis recaps what you know, now lets use these rules to solve the @eq-sist and in parallel see the corresponding matrix-vector version.\n\n-   **step 1:** Replace equation $l_2$ by, $l_2$ minus twice the equation $l_1$, i.e., make the new second equation $l_2'$ into $l_2-2l_1$. This gives us:\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{cases}x-4y =2\\\\2x-6y = 5\\end{cases} \\overset{l_2'=l_2-2l_1}{\\longrightarrow}\\begin{cases} x-4y =2\\\\ 2y = 1\\end{cases}\n    $$\n\n    Correspondingly we subtract from row $l_2$ twice the row $l_1$ in @eq-matrix_sist, giving us\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4\\\\ 2 & -6 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\5\\end{pmatrix}\\overset{l_2'=l_2-2l_1}{\\longrightarrow} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4\\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n-   **step 2:** Multiply equation $l_2$ by $1/2$:\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{cases} x-4y =2\\\\ 2y = 1\\end{cases}\\overset{l_2'=1/2l_2}{\\longrightarrow} \\begin{cases} x-4y =2\\\\ y = 1/2\\end{cases}\n    $$\n\n    In matrix-vector notation we find:\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4\\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}\\overset{l_2'=1/2l_2}{\\longrightarrow} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\1/2\\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n-   **step 3:** Since the system is simple enough, there are two way to go at this stage. You either substitute the equation $y=1/2$ into the first equation $x-4y=2$ and solve for $x$, this gives us the answer $x=4$ and $y=1/2$. The second way to to go about it, is to simplify even further the system of equations, we do that by replacing $l_1$ by, $l_1$ plus four times $l_2$:\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{cases} x-4y =2\\\\ y = 1/2\\end{cases}\\overset{l_1'=l_1+4l_2}{\\longrightarrow}\\begin{cases} x =4\\\\ y = 1/2\\end{cases}\n    $$\n\n    In matrix-vector notation we find:\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\1/2\\end{pmatrix}\\overset{l_1'=l_1+4l_2}{\\longrightarrow} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix}4\\\\1/2\\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n    From which we can read the final result $x=4$ and $y=1/2$.\n\nGoing through the three steps again we notice we can improve our matrix-vector notation by suppressing from it the column $\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}$ and writing instead the steps as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4 &\\bigm| & 2 \\\\ 2 & -6 &| & 5 \\end{pmatrix}\\overset{l_2'=l_2-2l_1}{\\longrightarrow} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4 &\\bigm| & 2\\\\ 0 & 2 &\\bigm| & 1\\end{pmatrix} \\overset{l_2'=1/2l_2}{\\longrightarrow} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4 &\\bigm| & 2\\\\ 0 & 1 &\\bigm| & 1/2\\end{pmatrix}\\overset{l_1'=l_1+4l_2}{\\longrightarrow} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 &\\bigm| & 4\\\\ 0 & 1 &\\bigm| & 1/2\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nFrom now on we'll adopt this way of writing systems of equations, its called the extended matrix notation, because we appended a new column to right side of the $2\\times2$ matrix. From the extended matrix we read the solution as follows\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 &\\bigm| & 4\\\\ 0 & 1 &\\bigm| & 1/2\\end{pmatrix}\\longrightarrow \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix}4\\\\1/2\\end{pmatrix}\\longrightarrow \\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix}4\\\\1/2\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nwhere in the last step we multiplied the vector by the matrix.\n\nThe vector\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}4\\\\1/2\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nis the solution of\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4\\\\ 2 & -6 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\5\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nMeaning, the solution of\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}x-4y =2\\\\2x-6y = 5\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nis:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}x =4\\\\y=1/2\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n## More examples of the elimination method\n\nThe following examples will be given:\n\n-   A system with one solution\n\n-   A system with no solution\n\n-   A system with many solutions\n\n-   Another system with many solutions\n\n### Example 1: A system with one solution\n\nConsider the system, which we write in three different notations.\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx+y-z=1\\\\\n2x-y+2z = 9\\\\\n2y=-x+z\n\\end{cases}\n\\leftrightsquigarrow\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & -1\\\\\n2 & -1 & 2\\\\\n1 & 2 &-1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx\\\\\ny\\\\\nz\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1\\\\\n9\\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\leftrightsquigarrow\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & -1 &\\bigm| & 1\\\\\n2 & -1 & 2 &\\bigm| & 9\\\\\n1 & 2 & -1 &\\bigm| & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$ {#eq-impossible_1}\n\nAgain we'll use the later notation during the elimination algorithm, because we don't have to carry around the $x$, $y$ and $z$ at each step.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n&\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & -1 &\\bigm| & 1\\\\2 & -1 & 2 &\\bigm| & 9\\\\1 & 2 & -1 &\\bigm| & 0\\end{pmatrix} \n\\overset{l_2'=l_2-2l_1\\\\l_3'=l_3-l_1}{\\longrightarrow}\n\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & -1 &\\bigm| & 1\\\\0 & -3 & 4 &\\bigm| & 7\\\\0 & 1 & 0 &\\bigm| & -1\\end{pmatrix} \n\\overset{l_2 \\leftrightarrow l_3}{\\longrightarrow}\n\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & -1 &\\bigm| & 1\\\\0 & 1 & 0 &\\bigm| & -1\\\\0 & -3 & 4 &\\bigm| & 7\\end{pmatrix}\\\\\n\\overset{l_3'=l_3+3l_2}{\\longrightarrow}\n&\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & -1 &\\bigm| & 1\\\\0 & 1 & 0 &\\bigm| & -1\\\\0 & 0 & 4 &\\bigm| & 4\\end{pmatrix} \n\\overset{l_3'=1/4l_3}{\\longrightarrow}\n\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & -1 &\\bigm| & 1\\\\0 & 1 & 0 &\\bigm| & -1\\\\0 & 0 & 1 &\\bigm| & 1\\end{pmatrix} \n\\overset{l_1'=l_1+l_3}{\\longrightarrow}\n\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & 0 &\\bigm| & 2\\\\0 & 1 & 0 &\\bigm| & -1\\\\0 & 0 & 1 &\\bigm| & 1\\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n\\overset{l_1'=l_1-l_2}{\\longrightarrow}\n&\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 &\\bigm| & 2\\\\0 & 1 & 0 &\\bigm| & -1\\\\0 & 0 & 1 &\\bigm| & 1\\end{pmatrix} \n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nMost of the system simplification (by elimination of variables) is done in this matrix-vector notation, looking at we find we went as far as we can, thus it is time to go back to the original notation - we find:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx = 3\\\\y=-1\\\\z=1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhich is the solution of the system of equations!

In which case, how many?\n\nImagine we have a system of equations before us - equivalently a matrix $A$ and a $\\mathbf{b}$ vector or equivalently an extended matrix. Whether we have one, none or many solution has to do with the coefficients of the system - equivalently it has to do with the choice of $A$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ or equivalently, it has to do with the entries of the extended matrix.\n\nOne way to answer the question is to solve the system and count how many solutions we find, elimination is a tool to do that.\n\nThe matrix-vector and then the extended matrix notation as just a new aesthetic for an actual system of equations. An aesthetic that made easier the use of the elimination algorithm, because it just focus on the coefficients; when the system is simple enough we went back to the system notation, to easily solve it.\n\nWhat we are going to do now is to give a deeper meaning to this notation, which in turn will make you see why some $A$'s together with $b$'s give one, none or many solutions. The matrix-vector notation or equivalently the extended matrix notation are like looking at an object, in this case a system of equation, from a different angle.\n\nBefore elaborating on what this deeper view is, we need some preparation, specifically we need to introduce the concepts:\n\n-   Matrix Multiplication and linear combination of rows\n\n-   Inverse Matrix\n\n-   Pivots and rank of a matrix\n\n-   Two special Subspaces: Column space and Nullspace\n\nWe'll focus on Example 4.\n\n## Matrix multiplication and linear combination of rows\n\nThe first step in @eq-example_4_system is\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 2 & 2\\\\2 & 4 & 6 & 8\\\\3 & 6 & 8 & 10 \\end{pmatrix}\\overset{l_2' = l_2-2l_1}{\\longrightarrow}\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\0 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\\\3 & 6 & 8 & 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1\\\\2\\\\3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\overset{l_2' = l_2-2l_1}{\\longrightarrow}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1\\\\0\\\\3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nImplicit was the following matrix multiplication:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 \\\\-2 & 1 & 0 \\\\0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\2 & 4 & 6 & 8 \\\\3 & 6 & 8 & 10\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\0 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\\\3 & 6 & 8 & 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 \\\\-2 & 1 & 0 \\\\0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\2\\\\3\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\3\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nHow do we do these calculations?\n\nThe general rule is:\n\n![Matrix multiplication of a 3x4 matrix by a 3x3 matrix.](figs/matrix_mult.png){#fig-mm width=\"523\"}\n\nwhere, for example:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\na_{22}'= e_{21}a_{12} + e_{22}a_{22} +e_{23}a_{32}\\\\\na_{23}'= e_{21}a_{13} + e_{22}a_{23} +e_{23}a_{33}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$ {#eq-ex_of_mm}\n\nLets name the matrices involved, the $e$'s matrix is called $E_1$ and the $a$'s matrix is called $A$, the result of the multiplication is called $A'$.\n\nObserving @fig-mm and @eq-ex_of_mm we see two important aspects about $E_1 A$\n\n1.  The shape of $E_1$ is $3\\times3$,the shape of $A$ is $3\\times 4$ and the shape of $A'$ is $3\\times4$.\n\n2.  The matrix $E_1$ needs to have as many columns as there are rows in $A$ (in this case $3$), otherwise it is not possible to do matrix multiplication. In other words, the compatible shapes for matrix multiplication are of the form $[m\\times r][r\\times n] = [m\\times n]$, for any integers $m,n,r$. For example, the case above is $[3\\times 3][3\\times 4]$ and thus $m=3$, $r=3$ and $n=4$.\n\n3.  The general formula for the entries of $A'$ is the complicated formula:\n\n    $$\n    a_{ij}'=\\sum_{k=1}^re_{ik}a_{kj}\n    $$\n\n## Inverse Matrix\n\nOnly square matrices can have inverses.\n\nNot every square matrix will have an inverse. For example $E_1$ is square, thus it may or not have an inverse $E_1^{-1}$, on the other hand the matrix $A$ is rectangular, thus no inverse exists.\n\nHow do we compute an inverse of a matrix?\n\nThe $E$'s matrices have inverses, always and thus:\n\n$$\nAx=b \\iff EAx=Eb \\iff A'x=b'\n$$\n\nare equivalent and and as a result their truth sets are equal! Finding the truth set of the later is easier than the former.\n\n## Two special subspaces\n\nHere we focus on the column space and nullspace of a matrix.\n\nThe column space is the vector space that is generated by taking all linear combinations of the columns of a matrix. For example, the column space of the matrix\n\n$$\nA=\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\2 & 4 & 6 & 8 \\\\3 & 6 & 8 & 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$ {#eq-the_matrix_A}\n\nfrom example 4 called $C(A)$ and is generated by\n\n$$\na\\begin{pmatrix}\n1\\\\2\\\\3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n+\nb\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\4\\\\6\\end{pmatrix}\n+\nc\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\6\\\\8\\end{pmatrix}\n+\nd\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\8\\\\10\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nIt may happen, and it is the case as we shall see, that we need not all the columns of $A$ to generate $C(A)$, the reason being, some of the column vectors may depend on other columns, thus not providing no additional information. At any rate, $C(A)$ always comes as a result of combining all the columns, it is just that some columns are redundant and we can generate the same with less.\n\nThe nullspace of a matrix, take again @eq-the_matrix_A, is the vector space generated by all solutions $\\mathbf{x}_N$ of the equation:\n\n$$\nA\\mathbf{x}_N=\\mathbf{0}\n$$\n\nThe concept of column space and nullspace will be key from now on.\n\n![](figs/plan.png){width=\"390\"}\n\n## Systems of equations from a new view\n\nThe system of equations used in example 4 is:\n\n$$\nA\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\n\\leftrightsquigarrow\n\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\2 & 4 & 6 & 8 \\\\3 & 6 & 8 & 10 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\\\z\\\\w\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\2\\\\3\\end{pmatrix}\n\\leftrightsquigarrow\n\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 2 & 2 &\\bigm|1\\\\2 & 4 & 6 & 8 &\\bigm|2\\\\3 & 6 & 8 & 10 &\\bigm| 3\\end{pmatrix}\n$$ {#eq-Axb_two_ways}\n\nWe can rewrite the system of equation in, yet, another manner:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\2\\\\3\\end{pmatrix}x+\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\4\\\\6\\end{pmatrix}y+\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\6\\\\8\\end{pmatrix}z+\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\8\\\\10\\end{pmatrix}w = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\2\\\\3\\end{pmatrix}\n$$ {#eq-Axb_lc}\n\nIn other words, a matrix times a column vector is a linear combination of the columns of the matrix. Under the @eq-Axb_two_ways we would ask, what is the column vector $\\mathbf{x}$ which when multiplied by the matrix $A$ yields the column vector $\\mathbf{b}$.\n\nUnder the @eq-Axb_lc we would ask: what is the linear combination of the columns that leads to the vector $\\mathbf{b}$ on the rhs. But now note: this combination is only possible, provided the $\\mathbf{b}$ vector is in the column space!\n\nThis crucial observation can be paraphrased differently; going back to @eq-Axb_two_ways, focus on the extended matrix version of the system of the equations and note, that, when we extend the matrix, i.e., when we append the $\\mathbf{b}$ vector on the rhs, the column space must not change, for otherwise the $\\mathbf{b}$ was not in the column space.\n\nMoreover, one more way, to paraphrase the paragraph above, the $\\mathbf{b}$ vector must be dependent on the columns of $A$.\n\n## Putting all together\n\nBecause the $E_k$ matrices are invertible we have the following equivalence:\n\n$A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b} \\iff A'\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}'$\n\nAnd thus the solutions of both equations are the same, in particular, following example 4 we have (using the extended-matrix notation) $$\n\\begin{align}\n&\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 2 & 2 &\\bigm|1\\\\\n2 & 4 & 6 & 8 &\\bigm|2\\\\\n3 & 6 & 8 & 10 &\\bigm| 3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\iff\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 0 & -2 &\\bigm| 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 2 &\\bigm| 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &\\bigm| 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nWe can rewrite both sides of the equivalence as the follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n&\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\2\\\\3\\end{pmatrix}x+\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\4\\\\6\\end{pmatrix}y+\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\6\\\\8\\end{pmatrix}z+\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\8\\\\10\\end{pmatrix}w = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\2\\\\3\\end{pmatrix}\\\\\n&\\iff\n\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}x+\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}y+\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}z+\\begin{pmatrix}-2\\\\2\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}w = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align}\n$$ {#eq-complex-simple}\n\nWhat this says, is that the coefficients that combine the columns of $A$ to give us the $\\mathbf{b}$ is exactly the same as the coefficients that, when combine the columns of $A'$ give us the vector $\\mathbf{b}'$.\n\nWe already know how to find the solution for this problem, see Section, what we want to do now to find the solution using the matrix-vector notation. The way you do it in this notation, provides you with deeper insight about when there is one, none or many solutions.\n\nHow would we find $x,y,z,w$ that satisfy the equations above?\n\n1.  Simplify the system as much as you can, we already did this. The lhs of @eq-complex-simple is complicated, but the rhs (full of zeros and many ones) is simple.\n\n2.  Identify the dependent and independent columns of the simple matrix. We do this by visual inspection:\n\n    The first and third columns can be linearly combined to generate the second and fourth columns:\n\n    $$\n    \\text{col}_2 =2\\text{col}_1\\qquad \\text{col}_4=2\\text{col}_3-2\\text{col}_1\n    $$\n\n    Notice the independent columns have an entry $1$ and the remaining entries are zeros, the independent columns are also called the pivot columns. The dependent columns are called free columns.\n\n    The $y$ and $w$ unknowns are the free unknowns.\n\n3.  To find a particular solution of the system, set the free unknowns to zero:\n\n    $$\n    y=0\\qquad w=0\n    $$\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}x\n    +\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}0\n    +\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}z\n    +\\begin{pmatrix}-2\\\\2\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}0 = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n4.  Now find $x$ and $z$, by inspection:\n\n    $$\n    x=1 \\qquad z=0\n    $$\n\n5.  The particular solution is\n\n    $$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\0\\\\0\\\\0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n6.  To find the general solution, compute the nullspace by solving $A'\\mathbf{x}_N=\\mathbf{0}$ and add it to the particular solution\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}x_N+\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}y_N\n    +\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}z_N+\\begin{pmatrix}-2\\\\2\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}w_N = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\n    $$ {#eq-nullspace_eq}\n\n    Reminding ourselves which columns are independent and which ones are dependent tells us how to find the solution. The column two and four can be built out from approriate linear combinations of column one and three.\n\n    To solve the equation we choose the free variables $y_N$ and $w_N$ as we wish and then solve for the $x_N$ and $z_N$. When choosing freely, at least choose something that simplify you calculations, for example set $y_N=1$ and $w_N=0$ in @eq-nullspace_eq and guess what is $x_N$ and $z;_N$ we get:\n\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{x}_N =\\begin{pmatrix}-2\\\\1\\\\0\\\\0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n    Now substitute $y_N=0$ and $w_N=1$ into @eq-nullspace_eq and guess the corresponding $x_N$ and $z_N$; the answer gives us:\n\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{x}_N=\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\0\\\\-2\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n    The nullspace of the matrix $A$ is composed by all linear combinations:\n\n    $$\n    a\\begin{pmatrix}-2\\\\1\\\\0\\\\0 \\end{pmatrix} +b\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\0\\\\-2\\\\1 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n7.  So far we know a particular solution for the problem $A\\mathbf{x}_p=\\mathbf{b}$ and we know the nullspace of $A$, the key observations is this:\n\n    If $\\mathbf{x}_P$ is a particular solution of $A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}$ then adding to it any $\\mathbf{x}_N$ will not make a difference.\n\n    Justification: $A(\\mathbf{x}_P+\\mathbf{x}_N)=A\\mathbf{x}_P+A\\mathbf{x}_N=\\mathbf{b}+\\mathbf{0}=\\mathbf{b}$\n\n    Thus, the system $A\\mathbf{x} =\\mathbf{b}$ has an infinite number of solutions, all of the form $\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{x}_P+\\mathbf{x}_N$.\n\n    For the matrix in question, the solutions are these:\n\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{x}=\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}+a\\begin{pmatrix}-2\\\\1\\\\0\\\\0 \\end{pmatrix} +b\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\0\\\\-2\\\\1 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$ {#eq-sol_2}\n\nIts important to compare the solutions @eq-sol_1 and @eq-sol_2.\n\nRearranging @eq-sol_1 we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}x &=1-2y&-&2w\\\\z &=&-&2w\\end{cases} \n\\iff\n\\begin{cases}\nx &= &1&+& &-&2a&+& &-&2b\\\\\ny &= & &+& &+&a&+& &+& \\\\\nz &= & &+& &+& &+& &-&2b\\\\\nw &= & &+& &+& &+& &+&b\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe rhs of this equivalence is exactly what @eq-sol_2 means!\n\n## One, none or many solutions?\n\nWith the above discussion understood we have the following cases:\n\n### Case: One solution\n\nWhen the matrix is square and when its *rref* is the identity, then there is only one solution!\n\nExample:\n\n![](figs/one_solution.png){width=\"292\"}\n\nThe solution of this example is $\\mathbf{x} =(3,-1,1)^T$.

I'm showing this example for you to see that we have to have as many independent equations as unknowns, only then we have a unique solution. The key take away is that a parameter dependent solution like @eq-parameter_dep_sol is equivalent to adding an equation ourselves.\n\n## Subspaces\n\n## Dot product\n\nFalar novamente dos subespaços
