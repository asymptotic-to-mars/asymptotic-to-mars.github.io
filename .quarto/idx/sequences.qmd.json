As $n$ gets larger and larger, then $2+1/n$ gets closer and closer to $2$.\n2.  The values $u_n$ never actually reaches the value of $2$ because $1/n$ is never zero, no matter how large $n$ is.\n\n**In other word:** the sequence $u_n$ *eventually* lies within **any** *interval centered at* $2$ that we can construct.\n\nLets make this wording rigorous:\n\n-   To say that an *interval centered at* $2$ contains a sequence means: $|2-u_n|<\\varepsilon$. The radius of the interval is $\\varepsilon$ and is positive, because we are speaking about an interval, not a point like thing!\n\n-   The *eventually* words means that $n$ after some value $N$ guarantees $|2-u_n|<\\varepsilon$\n\n-   The **any** word means, that the above is true for any positive $\\varepsilon$\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n-   \\(1\\) For any $\\varepsilon>0$, the following is true:\n\n    -   \\(2\\) That there exists some $N$ that guarantees that:\n\n        -   \\(3\\) for any $n\\geq N$ the following statement is true\n\n            -   \\(4\\) the statement that $|2-u_n|<\\varepsilon$\n\nWe write this description using complicated mathematical notation as:\n\n$$ \\overbrace{\\forall \\varepsilon >0 }^{(1)}:\\overbrace{\\exists N}^{(2)}:\\overbrace{\\forall  n\\geq N}^{(3)}: (\\overbrace{ |2-u_n|<\\varepsilon)}^{(4)} $$ {#eq-limit_of_seq}\n\nSince it is just complicated to write @eq-limit_of_seq, the following abbreviation is introduced:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\longrightarrow \\infty}u_n = 2\n$$\n\nThe lhs should be view as a single symbol that says: \"the limit value of $2+1/n$ when $n$ gets larger and larger (infinity is not a number)\". The rhs tell us that $2$ is the limit value; or better said, the point around which the sequence eventually *always* lurks. If a finite limit exists we say, $u_n$ converges (to $2$).\n\n::: callout-note\n## Commentary\n\n-   Sequences of the form $x_0\\pm1/n$ are important since they describe a step by step approach to the number $x_0$ from values above $+$ or below $-$; without never actually getting there.\n-   Some sequences may approach either $\\pm \\infty$ when $n$ gets larger and larger. In these cases we write: $$\n    \\left[\\lim u_n = \\pm \\infty\\right] := \\forall L > 0: \\exists N \\in \\mathbb{N}: N\\leq n \\implies L \\lg u_n\n    $$\n:::\n\nIn which case we say the sequence is divergent.\n\n# Proving a sequence converges\n\n## An example\n\nWe will prove that:\n\n$$\n\\lim \\frac{4n+1}{2n}=2\n$$\n\nMeaning we want to prove that:\n\n$$\n\\forall \\varepsilon >0:\\exists N:\\forall n\\geq N : |2-(4n+1)/2n|<\\varepsilon\n$$\n\nWe proceed by unpacking the meaning with indented assumptions:\n\n-   Assume we have some value $\\varepsilon$, though it is arbitrary:\n\n    -   We seek to find an $N$ that makes $\\forall n\\geq N : |2-(4n+1)/2n|<\\varepsilon$ true, i.e., we seek a lower bound on $n$ that makes this true:\n\n        -   To do that, we assume that we have some value $n^*$ which is larger than the $N$ and which makes the statement $|2-(4n^*+1)/2n^*|<\\varepsilon$ true. This much we know about $n^*$. No special conclusion was taken, yet.\n\n            Now simplify this statement and see if we find something new about $n^*$:\n\n            $$\n            \\begin{align}\n            & |2-\\frac{4n^*+1}{2n^*}|<\\varepsilon\\\\\n            &\\implies |\\frac{4n^*-4n^*+1}{2n^*}|<\\varepsilon\\\\\n            &\\implies |\\frac{1}{2n^*}|<\\varepsilon\\\\\n            &\\implies n^*>\\frac{1}{2\\varepsilon}\n            \\end{align}\n            $$\n\nNow, this is significant! Lets recollect what we found in the three indentations: Given a radius $\\varepsilon$, a $n^*$bounded below by $N$ and which obeys our statement is a $n^*$ larger than $1/2\\varepsilon$. The consequences of this are inescapable. If you choose smaller and smaller $\\varepsilon$ the larger and larger $n^*$ must be. $\\varepsilon$ can be make as small as we wish and we can always find, through the inequality $n^*>1/2\\varepsilon$, a $n^*$ that makes $|2-(4n^*+1)/2n^*|<\\varepsilon$ true. And since $N$ is smaller than $n^*$ we can, in conclusion, always say it exist a lower bound $N$ for this $n^*$.\n\nTo say $\\lim \\frac{4n+1}{2n}=2$ is just an abbreviation for the whole reasoning made above!\n\n## Reference sequences limits\n\nUsing arguments such as the one shown above we can establish a myriad of limits for basic sequences, we are going ino the details of the proofs and just list the results:\n\n-   $\\lim \\frac{a}{b}=\\frac{a}{b}$ provided $b\\not = 0$\n\n-   $\\lim \\frac{an+b}{cn+d}=\\frac{a}{c}$ provided $c\\not = 0$\n\n-   $\\lim \\frac{1}{n^p} =0$, if $p>0$\n\n-   so on ...\n\nWe can also prove basic rules for limits, an important one is:\n\n-   If $a_n$ and $b_n$ are convergent to limits $a$ and $b$, then:\n\n    -   the sequence $a_n+b_n$ converges to $a+b$.\n\n    -   the sequence $a_nb_n$ converges to $ab$\n\n    -   the sequence $a_n/b_n$ converges to $a/b$ if $b\\not=0$\n\n    -   so on...\n\n**The idea behind these pre-made limits and the rules is similar to the one from derivatives:** If you want to compute a limit of complicated sequence, then your goal is to rearrange that sequence and the limit in such a way that the basic pre-made limits can be used.
