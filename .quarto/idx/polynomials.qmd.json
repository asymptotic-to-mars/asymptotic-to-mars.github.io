For example the equation $y=100$ is the rule we want for the first polynomial in @eq-egsofpol, therefore this function is composed by all ordered pairs $(x,y)$ with $y$ equal to $100$, while $x$ ranges on all reals.\n\n-   To interpret the notation as a whole, take $\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\,|\\,\\, y=3x+1\\}$.

As an example, the pair $(1.3,2.9)$ obeys the equation because $2.9 = 3\\times 1.3 +1$ is true, therefore it belong to the set, but $(1,3)$ does not since $3=3\\times 1 +1$ is false.\n\nThe equations we wrote after $|$ allow us to compute from a given $x$ a unique value $y$. As an example of this fact, choose the equation of the second polynomial, $y=3x+1$, plug in $x=0$, what do we get? We get $y=3\\cdot 0 +1$, that is, just the number $y=1$. Notice we do not get other possible value for $y$, we just get the $y=1$, no other possibility; in fact the same happens for any other $x$ we choose. This is such an obvious fact we actually skip by it. But it is important, because the fact that the equations in @eq-egsofpol have that property ensures us that each possible value of $x$ does not appear two or more times within these set.

We want to compute the set $c(\\mathbb{R})$, to do it, we note by inspecting $x^2+3$ that its minimum value occurs when $x=0$ and the larger the $x$, the larger is $x^2+3$, thus $c(\\mathbb{R})=[3,+\\infty[$, which is a subset of the codomain $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n```{python}\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \nimport numpy as np\n\nxs = np.arange(-2.0, 2.1, 0.1)\n\nplt.figure()\nplt.subplot(211)\nplt.plot(xs, np.ones([len(xs)]) * 100, 'r-')\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('l(x)')\n\nplt.subplot(212)\nplt.plot(xs, xs**2 + 3, 'b-')\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('g(x)')\nplt.show()\n```\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"polynomials.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
