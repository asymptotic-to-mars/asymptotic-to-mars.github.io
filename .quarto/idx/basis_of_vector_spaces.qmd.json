When you text emojis, you are texting a l.c.\n:::\n\n## Is it a basis or not? Of which vector space?\n\nLooking at our definition above we can see that any set of independent vectors constitute a basis of some vector space. Essentially to determine whether a set is a basis or not is the same as asking whether the vectors are or not independent, and this question was already addressed before.\n\nFor the moment lets see two examples.\n\n**Example 1:** Imagine the following spans:\n\n$$\nA=\\{\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix},\\begin{pmatrix} 3\\\\0\\end{pmatrix},\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\3\\end{pmatrix}\\}\\qquad B=\\{\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix},\\begin{pmatrix} 3\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\\}\n$$\n\nOnly the $B$ has the status of a basis. Why? See the definition above and checking the two criteria, $B$ fulfills both but $A$ does not fulfill the independence criteria.\n\nWe can check this by solving:\n\n$$\n\\alpha \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix} +\\beta \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}+\\gamma\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nwhose solution is: $\\gamma=2$, $\\alpha=1$ and $\\beta= -1$. The $B$ basis, expands a space with dimension $2$.\n\n**Example 2:** Consider now the st:\n\n$$ C=\\{( 1,0,1),(0,0,1)\\}\\qquad D=\\{( 1,0,1),( 0,0,1),( 1,0,3)\\} $$\n\nThe set $C$ is a basis that expands a two dimensional space, because we have two vectors. We can actually say more, because these vectors live in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and hence this space is in fact a subspace of it. The set $D$ is not a basis because the vectors are not independent; the solution is $\\alpha=1$, $\\beta=2$ and $\\gamma=-1$. Note, by the criteria 1. of a basis, $C$ is not a basis of $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Commentary\n\n-   To test the (in)dependence of a candidate set to basis vectors will be equivalent to solving a problem like $A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}$.\n\n-   If we have a set of independent vectors, then they generate a vector space. We describe the space as: $A = span\\{\\mathbf{v}_1,\\dots,\\mathbf{v}_n\\}$ and $\\dim A =n$. Later we'll see another way to describe the set: also through the equation of the form $\\tilde{A}\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}$, whose solutions are the $\\mathbf{v}_1,\\dots\\mathbf{v}_n$.\n\nSo, the same kind of problem $A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}$ will, as we shall see, occur in two situations: test (in)dependence of sets of vectors, generate a basis for a subspace.\n:::\n\n**Exercises:** 1.5.1,2\n\n## Creating the appropriate basis for a vector space?\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Video\n\n[example below](https://youtu.be/gMlajHd5m8A){target=\"_blank\"}\n:::\n\n**Example 1:** Imagine we have the following set $A=\\{(1,1,0),(1,0,1)\\}$ how do we create from it a basis for $\\mathbb{R}^3$? Well, we have to append to this set one new vectors that point in different direction. That way we would have three independent vectors living in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ which would allow us to cover the entire space by l.c. The new vector cannot be a l.c. of the vectors already present in $A$.\n\nTo find the new vector in a systematic manner, we notice, a key aspect of it, *since the missing vector belongs to* $\\mathbb{R}^3$*, then it has the form* $(a,b,c)$ *for* $a,b,c\\in \\mathbb{R}$*.* Our problem, is thus to make the third column of the following matrix\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & a\\\\1 & 0 & b\\\\0 & 1 & c\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nindependent of the first two, to achieve that we simplify it through elimination:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & a\\\\\n1 & 0 & b\\\\\n0 & 1 & c\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\overset{l_2'=l_2-l_1}{\\longrightarrow}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & a\\\\\n0 & -1 & b-a\\\\\n0 & 1 & c\\end{pmatrix}\n\\overset{l_2\\leftrightarrow l_3}{\\longrightarrow}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & a\\\\\n0 & 1 & c\\\\\n0 & -1 & b-a\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\overset{l_3'=l_3+l_2}{\\longrightarrow}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mathbf{1} & 1 & a\\\\\n0 & \\mathbf{1} & c\\\\\n0 & 0 & b-a+c\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nWe identify pivots in the first two columns, meaning they are independent, we want now to choose $a,b,c\\in \\mathbb{R}$ so such that we gain a third pivot at position $A_{33}$. For example: $b=1$ and $a=c =0$ guarantees that $b-a+c\\not =0$, a new pivot emerged!\n\nWe conclude the set $A'=\\{(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,0\\}$ has only independent vectors and is a basis of $\\mathbf{R}^3$.\n\n**Example 2:** Assume not the set $A=\\{(0,0,1)\\}$ and we want to complete $A$ so as to turn it into a basis of the subspace $\\{(x,y,z)\\in\\mathbb{R}^3\\,\\,|\\,\\, y=2x\\}$; notice this is our **\\[pink-blue plane\\]**. *Since the missing vector belongs to this plane, then it must have the form* $(a,2a,b)$. \\[Note: $(0,0,1)$ fits this form.\\]\n\nTo answer, we have to simplify:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & a\\\\\n0 & 2a\\\\\n1 & b \n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\overset{l_1\\leftrightarrow l_3}{\\longrightarrow}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mathbf{1} & b\\\\\n0 & 2a\\\\\n0 & a \n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nWe have one pivot in column 1 and want a second pivot in column 2. A possible solution to the candidate $2a$ into a pivot is choose $b=0$ and $a=1$. Thus $A'=\\{(0,0,1),(1,2,0)\\}$ is a basis for the **\\[pink-blue subspace\\]**.\n\n**Example 3:** Suppose we have the following vector space $\\mathbb{V}=\\{(x,y)\\,\\,|\\,\\, x+2y-3z=0\\}$. Note it is a two dimensional space because the three entries of the vector are constrained by the equation; another way to arrive at this conclusion is to recognize that the equation is the equation of plane perpendicular to $(1,2,-3)$ that passes (as any vector space should) through the origin. Choosing values for two of the variables and solving for the third yields the desired vectors, for example, let $z=0$ and $y=-1/2$, then $x=1$; choosing $y=0$ and $z=1$ gives us $x=3$. These calculation gave us two basis vectors:\n\n$$\nC=\\{(1,-1/2,0),(3,0,1)\\}\n$$\n\nwhich are clearly independent.\n\n**Exercises:** 1.5.3,6,7\n\n# Representing a vector wrt a basis\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Video\n\n[the example below](https://youtu.be/sP1qyI29icE){target=\"_blank\"}\n:::\n\nAssume we have a basis $B=\\{(1,1,0),(0,1,1),(1,0,2)\\}$ and the vector $\\mathbf{v}=(1,2,4)$.
