If values of some of these parameters are given, these equations can be used to compute the other.\n\nAs example: You give $a_0$ and $a_1$ and I can compute $x_0$ and $y_0$. How? If you give me $a_0=3$ and $a_1=2$, I pick an arbitrary $x_0$, for example $x_0=4$ and compute\n\n$$\ny_0=3+2\\times 4=11\n$$\n\nIn conclusion we have two equations aesthetically different but exactly the same:\n\n$$\ny=2x+3 \\iff y=2(x-4)+11\n$$ {#eq-example1}\n\nThe right hand side aesthetic is much better because it allow us to see easily how fast these polynomials of degree one increase.\n\n<!--# What is $(x_0,y_0)$?  I mean, what is $(4,10)$ in @eq-example1 ? They are the coordinates of one particular point that belong to that line. It is very important to recognize that the line (or should I say, the set of points described by $y=2(x-4)+11$), could equally be described by the equations $y=2(x-3)+9$ or $y=2(x-1)+5$, or one of the infinitely many other possibilities. What makes them different is the choice of our favorite point $(x_0,y_0)$ of the line. For each, the equation of the line shows up with different clothing.  -->\n\n### *How fast does the function increase?*\n\nThe constant $m$ (the $2$ in @eq-example1) is called the slope of the line, what does it mean the value of the slope? The meaning of this constant - in fact any constant in mathematics - can be deduced by analyzing the equation in which it appears. In this case, we understand $m$ by understanding $y=m(x-x_0)+y_0$, rearranging it we find:\n\n$$\nm=\\frac{y-y_0}{x-x_0}\n$$ {#eq-slope_formula}\n\nwhich tells us that $m$ is a ratio of two distances, the height of the triangle $y-y_0$ and the length of the base of the triangle $x-x_0$.\n\n![A line and two point.](figs/oneline.png){#fig-alineandtwopoints fig-env=\"fig-lineandtwopoints\" width=\"407\"}\n\nSince $m$ is the ratio of these two distances, its sign determines weather the function is increasing or not. Observing @fig-window we see $x-x_0>0$ and $y-y_0>0$ therefore for this particular choice of two points we find $m>0$, the same conclusion would hold for any other. When $m$ is positive, then the $y$'s in $(x,y)$ increase when the $x$'s increase as well.\n\nBy the same line of reasoning the $m<0$ would correspond to decreasing function, one where as $x$ increases then the $y$'s decrease. And by the way, $m=0$ correspond to horizontal lines but these are polynomials of degree zero and not of degree one. The larger $m$ becomes the closer the line is to a vertical line, but it never truly becomes a vertical line.\n\nWe can actually arrive at these conclusions just looking at $y=m(x-x_0)+y_0$, no rearranging required: when $m$ is positive, then the greater $x-x_0$ is, the more we add to the default value $y_0$, thus the $y$ must increase; if on the other hand $m$ is negative, the term $m(x-x_0)$ can only become more negative as $x-x_0$ increases, thus lowering the value of $m(x-x_0)+y_0$, that is, the value of $y$, the function must be decreasing when $x-x_0$ increases.\n\n### *Zeros*\n\nWhat are the zeros in $P_1$? Look at @fig-alineandtwopoints, there are (in this case) two types of zeros: $x$-zeros and $y$-zeros. The $x$-zeros occur when the $x$ coordinate is zero and the $y$-zeros when $y$ is zero. In other words, the zeros of a polynomials of degree one are the ordered pairs (in $P_1$) that satisfy either one of these equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\\begin{cases}y=y_0+m(x-x_0)\\\\y=0\\end{cases}\\qquad\\qquad\\begin{cases}y=y_0+m(x-x_0)\\\\x=0\\end{cases}\\end{equation}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\\begin{cases}y_0=a_1x_0+a_0\\\\y=0\\end{cases}\\qquad\\qquad\\begin{cases}y=a_1x+a_0\\\\x=0\\end{cases}\\end{equation}\n$$\n\n$$\n(x_0,0)\\in \\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\,|\\,\\, y = a_1x+a_0 \\}\n$$\n\n$$\n(0,y_0)\\in \\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\,|\\,\\, y = a_1x+a_0 \\}\n$$\n\nSolving the first systems of equations we get $x=(0-y_0)/m+x_0$ and solving the second $y=y_0+m(0-x_0)$. Hence we know zeros of $P_1$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n&\\textit{x-zero:} \\qquad (0,y_0-mx_0)\\\\\n&\\textit{y-zero:} \\qquad (x_0-y_0/m,0)\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n### *When* $x$ *is large, then what?*\n\nWe can get to know qualitatively what happens with points coordinates of $P_1$ at its extreme ends of the set by supposing $x$ is a very, very large number; there is however an important key point: we are not particularly worried about a specific large value of $x$, like $x=10^{100}$ , and its corresponding $y$; what we really want to know is - as $x$ is getting larger and larger, how does $y$ behave then? It is a dynamical process, not a specific evaluation of the function.\n\n![](figs/the_land.png)\n\nParaphrased differently, we want to know what happens to $(x,y)$ during the process of making $x$ bigger and bigger? To state that $x$ is getting bigger and bigger, we write $x\\longrightarrow \\infty$. In such a dynamic case, what happens with the value $y$? Meaning, what is the dynamic solution $y$ of the system:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\\begin{cases}y=y_0+m(x-x_0)\\\\x\\longrightarrow +\\infty\\end{cases}\\end{equation}\n$$ {#eq-system_lim}\n\nLets make an intuitive guess about the solution of this problem (later, when we study limits we'll see a more systematic way to solve these problems), the @fig-lims helps a lot. To understand how the values of $y$ behave when $x$ increases, we have to understand how the calculation $y_0+m(x-x_0)$ behaves, when we keep increasing $x$. A key aspect of it, is that the term $m x$ gets larger and larger while $y_0-mx_0$ remains a constant, eventually, $mx$ is so much larger than this constant (we are increasing $x$ after all) that our original equation $y=y_0+m(x-x_0)$ becomes approximately given by $y\\sim mx$. The functions $y_0+m(x-x_0)$ and $mx$ are different! But when $x$ is large they are very similar because the constant $y_0-mx_0$ becomes irrelevant. Now we shift our focus to the approximate equation and try to solve it:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\\begin{cases}y\\sim mx\\\\x\\longrightarrow +\\infty\\end{cases}\\end{equation}\n$$ {#eq-system_lim_approx}\n\nThis is easy, because its just an atomic polynomial. The dynamical solution to this problem is \\[ $y$ will increase when $x$ increases\\], we write the answer as $y\\longrightarrow +\\infty$ when $m$ is positive. As a consequence the answer to @eq-system_lim is also $y\\longrightarrow +\\infty$.\n\nObserve that the function $y\\sim mx$ is not equal to $y=y_0+m(x-x_0)$, and thus their graphs are not equal, but when $x$ is very large, they are *similar*, see picture below. Solving @eq-system_lim_approx we automatically get the answer to the problem @eq-system_lim . Both answers are $y\\longrightarrow+\\infty$.\n\n![Does y grow when x grows?](figs/lims.png){#fig-lims width=\"453\"}\n\nIf on the other hand $m$ is negative then, by the same reasoning, $y$ also becomes very negative.\n\n**Awful Exercise:** What happens to $y$ when $x\\longrightarrow-\\infty$?\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Polynomials of degree one are lines\n\nPolynomials of degree one are lists of ordered pairs of the form:\n\n$$\n\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\,|\\,\\, y=a_1 x+a_0\\}\n$$ {#eq-poldeg1}\n\nThe constants $a_1$ and $a_0$ are either given to us or we must choose them - we say they are parameter of the function - they are the weights of $x^1$ and $x^0$ in the linear combination $a_1x+a_0$.
