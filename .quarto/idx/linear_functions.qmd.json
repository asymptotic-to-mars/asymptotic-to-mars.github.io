Now we enter a more conceptual part of the course and organize ideas.\n\n\n*Suspend what you know:* We have been speaking about a vector space as being closed under linear combinations. However if we stop to think about it, we can only compute a linear combination provided we know how to multiply vectors by numbers and how to add vectors, see below:\n\n$$\n\\overbrace{\\alpha u}^\\text{number times a vector} + \\overbrace{\\beta v}^\\text{number times a vector}=\\underbrace{u'+v'}_\\text{sum of vectors}\n$$\n\nFor the moment we will consider these two operations in separate and also for the moment suspend how they are done in practice, thus, when we think about:\n\n$$\n(1,3)+(4,7)=?\\qquad 10(2,5)=?\n$$\n\nWe do not know how to do these operations.\n\nNow lets return to the idea of a vector space.\n\n*Today:* A set of things is just a list. Let us label those things as\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{V}=\\{v_1,v_2,\\dots,v_n\\}\n$$\n\nWhat can we do with the things in this set?\n\nWe can define a map, a map is a rule or sequence of operations that tell me how to assigns to each pair of elements in $\\mathbb{V}$ a new element in $\\mathbb{V}$. Right now, we are not thinking about a specific map, you can even imagine (if it helps you) that aliens choose the map, but did not told us what it is (except for that fact that they chose one.)\n\nAnother kind of map they decide to introduce, for which we do not know yet how it operates consists in assigning to each pairing of a real number and an element of $\\mathbb{V}$, another element of $\\mathbb{V}$.\n\nThe notion of map as we just described in words is described in mathematical notation as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n+ : \\mathbb{V}\\times\\mathbb{V} &\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{V}\\\\\n(u,v)&\\longmapsto u\\tilde{+}v\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\\cdot : \\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{V} &\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{V}\\\\(\\alpha,v)&\\longmapsto \\alpha\\cdot v\\end{align}\n$$\n\nThe $u+v$ is the symbol for the element in $\\mathbb{V}$ that corresponds to the pair $(u,v)$. And $\\alpha\\cdot v$ is the symbol for the element assigned to $(\\alpha,v)$.\n\nNow they disclose to us a few properties that their maps have:\n\n-   Commutative: $u+v=v+u$. \\[*You can flip the order*\\]\n\n-   Associative: $(u+v)+w=u+(v+w)$. \\[*You can shift the brackets*\\]\n\n-   Neutral element: There is a neutral element wrt to $+$: There is an element in $\\mathbf{V}$, call it $o$ so that for all $u\\in \\mathbb{V}$ we find $u+o=u$. \\[*This is not* $0$ *from the real numbers, it is the zero of* $\\mathbb{V}$*. To avoid confusion you can call* $o$ *as circle rather than zero.*\\]\n\n-   Inverse element: For every element $u$ there an element, which we denote by $-u$, that guarantees $u+(-u)=o$. \\[ $u-v$ is just a short notation for $u+(-v)$\\]\n\nThe next list of rules describe how the operations $+$ and $\\cdot$ interact when both present in a calculation, two of this rules are distributive rules:\n\n-   Associative: $\\alpha(\\beta u)=(\\alpha\\beta)v$\n\n-   Distributive I: $(\\alpha+\\beta)u = \\alpha u +\\beta u$\n\n-   Distributive II: $\\alpha (u +v) = \\alpha u + \\alpha v$\n\n-   Unitary: $1 u = u$\n\nWe do not know specifically how the assignments are made, the only thing we know is: whatever they are, they obey the rules above.\n\nA vector space is a triplet $(\\mathbb{V},+,\\cdot)$\n\nIts like describing someone: you can list all its characteristics, or just list the essential one. Here essential depends for what the description is useful for.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Commentary\n\nWhy is maps and these rules? Because on them fit many useful maps in practice.\n\nThese rules all boil down to $\\mathbb{V}$ is closed under l.c. where the l.c. is realized in practice the natural and expected way. The rules above are the rules of common sense for l.c.\n:::\n\nWhat specific sets and $+$ and $\\cdot$ operations fit the profile above? Here are some examples:\n\n## Example 1 of a vector space\n\nThe set of all polynomials:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}=\\{\\dots+a_n x^n+a_{n-1} x^{n-1} +\\dots +a_1 x +a_0\\,\\,|\\,\\, a_i \\text{'s are real}\\}\n$$\n\nTogether with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}+ : \\mathbb{P}\\times\\mathbb{P} &\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{V}\\\\(p,q)&\\longmapsto (p+q)(x)=p(x)+q(x)\\end{align}\n$$\n\nHere, the $+$ sign between functions $p$ and $q$ manifests in practice as the summation $+$ of real numbers $p(x)$ and $q(x)$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\\cdot : \\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{P} &\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{V}\\\\(\\alpha,p)&\\longmapsto (\\alpha\\cdot p)(x):=\\alpha\\cdot p(x)\\end{align}\n$$\n\nThe multiplication between a real number and the function $p$ is understood in therms of the multiplication between the real number $\\alpha$ and $p(x)$.\n\nAll the rules above can be checked for this example.\n\nThe natural basis for this vector space is: $\\{1,x,x^2,\\dots\\}$\n\n## Example 2 of a vector space\n\nConsider the set:\n\n$\\mathbb{V} = \\{(x,y)\\,\\,|\\,\\, x,y\\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$\n\nAnd the maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n+ : \\mathbb{V}\\times\\mathbb{V} &\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{V}\\\\\n(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v})&\\longmapsto \\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{v} := (u_x,u_y)+(v_x,v_y)=(u_x+v_x,u_y+v_y)\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\\cdot : \\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{V} &\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{V}\\\\(\\alpha,\\mathbf{u})&\\longmapsto \\alpha\\cdot \\mathbf{u}:=(\\alpha u_x,\\alpha u_y)\\end{align}\n$$\n\nOnce again the summation of vectors is in practice the summation of numbers and the multiplication of a vector by a real number means the multiplication of its entries (real numbers) by the real number $\\alpha$.\n\nNotice that when I write $(u_x,u_y)+(v_x,v_y)$ one may wonder what it means, we know it is another element of $\\mathbf{V}$, but which one? To answer that we have to tell how the operation $+$ between two elements of $\\mathbb{V}$ actually maps. Whatever the way it maps, it must be consistent with the rules defined above. It turn out that to define this $+$ as doing $(u_x+v_x,u_y+v_y)$ (a plus between reals) is a good and useful choice.\n\nThe natural choice of basis for this vector space is: $\\{(1,0),(0,1)\\}$\n\n# Intuitive idea of structure of a vs (Retirar?)\n\nFor example let us define the summation and multiplication by a number.\n\nFor example take $\\mathbb{R}^2$, we know that:\n\n$$\n(1,3)+(0,1) = (1,4)\n$$\n\nTherefore, the vectors $(1,3)$ and $(0,1)$ are connected to $(1,4)$.\n\nWhen I multiply a vector by number:\n\n$$\n3(1,9) = (3,27)\n$$\n\nand as a result the vector $(1,9)$ is connected with $(3,27)$.\n\nA generic l.c. $\\alpha(1,3)+\\beta(0,1) = (\\alpha,3\\alpha+\\beta)$. Connects $\\alpha(1,3)$ and $\\beta(0,1)$ with $(\\alpha,3\\alpha+\\beta)$.\n\nThe operation l.c. creates this web of connectivity between elements of a vector space.\n\n# Linear functions\n\nConsider two vector spaces $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\mathbb{R}^m$. As such they are closed under l.c. and present a structure of connectivity among its elements.\n\nA linear function is a bridge between elements of both vectors spaces, but it is not just any bridge, it a bridge that is constructed following one rule.\n\n::: {#def-linear_func style=\"color:gray\"}\nLet $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\mathbb{R}^m$ be two vector spaces (thus with their own structure induced by the operation of l.c.)\n\nA linear function is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nf:\\mathbb{R}^n&\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^m\\\\\n\\bf{u}&\\longmapsto f(\\bf{u})\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nsuch that the following rule is obeyed: $f(\\lambda \\bf{u}+\\mu \\bf{v}) = \\lambda f (\\bf{u}) + \\mu f(\\bf{v})$\n\nfor all $\\lambda,\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\bf{u},\\bf{v}\\in \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\n*Terminology:* The vector space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is the domain of the function $f$, while $\\mathbb{R}^m$ is the codomain (of $f$)\n\nwhen referring to a linear function well use $\\sim$ and write: $f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\overset{\\sim}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathbb{R}^m$.\n:::\n\nLets see some example, as well as answer the question: Is it linear or not?\n\n## Is it linear or not?\n\n### Example 1:\n\nConsider the function:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}f:\\mathbb{R}&\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\\\ x&\\longmapsto f(x):=ax\\end{align}\n$$\n\nwhere $a$ is some real constant. This is a typical high-school function also known as proportionality function aka polynomial of degree one.\n\nThe domain and codomain are both $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nTo check its linear we choose two generic elements of the domain $x_1$ and $x_2$ and l.c. them using a generic coefficients $c_1$ and $c_2$ :\n\n$$\nf(c_1 x_1+ c_2 x_2) = a ( c_1 x_1+ c_2 x_2) = ac_1 x_1+ ac_2 x_2 = c_1f(x_1)+c_2f(x_2)\n$$\n\nIndeed it is.\n\n### Example 2:\n\nNow a function from $\\mathbb{R}$ into $\\mathbb{R}^2$\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}g:\\mathbb{R}&\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2\\\\ x&\\longmapsto g(x):=(2x,x)\\end{align}\n$$\n\nIs this function linear?\n\n$$\ng(c_1 x_1+ c_2 x_2)=(2(c_1 x_1+ c_2 x_2),c_1 x_1+ c_2 x_2) = c_1(2x_1+,x_1)+c_2(2x_2,x_2)=c_1g(x_1)+c_2g(x_2)\n$$\n\nBecause our choices where arbitrary, yes, this $g$ is linear.\n\n### Example 3:\n\nThe projection function, picks out the $x$ component of the vector $(x,y)$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\\pi:\\mathbb{R}^2&\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\\\ (x,y)&\\longmapsto \\pi(x,y):=x\\end{align}\n$$\n\nIs it linear?\n\n$$\n\\pi(c_1(x_1,y_1)+c_2(x_2,y_2)) = \\pi (c_1x_1+c_2x_2,c_1y_1+c_2y_2)=c_1x_1+c_2x_2 =c_1 \\pi(x_1,y_1) + c_2\\pi(x_2,y_2)\n$$\n\nA l.c. of inputs - $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ - yields the same l.c. of outputs - $\\pi(x_1,y_1)$ and $\\pi(x_2,y_2)$.\n\n### Example 4:\n\nFrom $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\mathbb{R}^2$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\\Phi:\\mathbb{R}^2&\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2\\\\ (x,y)&\\longmapsto \\Phi(x,y):=(2x-y,x+y)\\end{align}\n$$\n\nIs it?\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\Phi(c_1(x_1,y_1)+c_2(x_2,y_2)) &= \\Phi(c_1x_1+c_2x_2,c_1y_1+c_2y_2)\\\\ \n&=(2(c_1x_1+c_2x_2)-(c_1y_1+c_2y_2),c_1x_1+c_2x_2+c_1y_1+c_2y_2)\\\\\n&=c_1(2x_1-y_1,x_1+y_1)+c_2(2x_2-y_2,x_2+y_2)\\\\\n&=c_1\\Phi(x_1,y_1)+c_2\\Phi(x_2,y_2)\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nYes.\n\n### Example 5:\n\nFrom $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\mathbb{R}^2$ once more:\n\n$$ \\begin{align}\\Xi:\\mathbb{R}^2&\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2\\\\ (x,y)&\\longmapsto \\Xi(x,y):=(2x-2y,x-y)\\end{align} $$\n\n?\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\Xi(c_1(x_1,y_1)+c_2(x_2,y_2)) &= \\Xi(c_1x_1+c_2x_2,c_1y_1+c_2y_2)\\\\\n &=(2(c_1x_1+c_2x_2)-2(c_1y_1+c_2y_2),c_1x_1+c_2x_2-c_1y_1-c_2y_2)\\\\\n&=c_1(2x_1-2y_1,x_1-y_1)+c_2(2x_2-2y_2,x_2-y_2)\\\\\n&=c_1\\Xi(x_1,y_1)+c_2\\Xi(x_2,y_2)\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nIt is.\n\n### Example 6: (NON-linear)\n\nAgain, from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\mathbb{R}^2$, but this time we have a square involved, hence the name square function:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\\square:\\mathbb{R}^2&\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2\\\\ (x,y)&\\longmapsto \\square(x,y):=(2x^2,y)\\end{align}\n$$\n\nChecking as usual:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\square(c_1(x_1,y_1)+c_2(x_2,y_2))&=\\square(c_1x_1+c_2x_2,c_1y_1+c_2y_2)\\\\\n&=(2(c_1x_1+c_2x_2)^2,c_1y_1+c_2y_2)\\\\\n&=(2((c_1x_1)^2+2c_1c_2x_1x_2+(c_2x_2)^2),c_1y_1+c_2y_2)\\\\\n&\\not=c_1\\square(x_1,y_1)+c_2\\square(x_2,y_2)\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nThe range is $\\square(\\mathbb{R}^2)=[0,\\infty)\\times\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Commentary\n\n-   It is usual to give a more break down $f(\\nu \\bf{u}+\\lambda \\bf{v}) = \\nu f (\\bf{u}) + \\lambda f(\\bf{v})$ into two rules:\n\n    -   $f(\\bf{u}+\\bf{v})=f(\\bf{u})+f(\\bf{v})$\n\n    -   $f(\\lambda \\bf{u})=\\lambda f(\\bf{u})$\n\n    Rather than checking one more complex rule we can check two simpler rules.\n\n-   Notice the summation and multiplication are defined in distinct vector spaces.\n:::\n\n## Example 7: Matrices are procedures that define linear functions\n\n**Idea:** Consider two vector spaces $\\mathbb{R}^4$ and $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The vectors that live in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ have the form $\\mathbf{x}=(x,y,z,w)$ while those in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ are $\\mathbf{u}=(u,v,t)$.\n\nA function $f$ that maps vectors from $\\mathbb{R}^4$ and $\\mathbb{R}^3$ can be constructed from the procedure $A\\mathbf{x}$.\n\nWe define this function as:\n\n$$ \\begin{align} f:\\mathbb{R}^4&\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^3\\\\ \\mathbf{x}&\\longmapsto f(\\mathbf{x}):=A\\mathbf{x}  \\end{align} $$\n\nwhere $A$ is for example (an already familiar matrix):\n\n$$ A=\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\2 & 4 & 6 & 8 \\\\3 & 6 & 8 & 10 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nIts shape tell us all, $4$ columns ready to multiply the $4$ coefficients in $(x,y,z,w)$ returning a $3$ entry vector $A\\mathbf{x}$.\n\nNotice how the property $A(\\alpha \\mathbb{x} +\\beta \\mathbf{y})=\\alpha A\\mathbf{x} +\\beta A \\mathbf{y}$ leads to $f$ being linear as well$f(\\alpha \\mathbb{x} +\\beta \\mathbf{y})=\\alpha f(\\mathbf{x}) +\\beta f (\\mathbf{y})$.\n\nEssentially, what we want with the introduction of this $f$ is to name an idea already present in $A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}$, the idea that the $A\\mathbf{x}$ part of the equation is a function that maps $\\mathbf{x}$ into the vector $A\\mathbf{x}$. With this idea in mind, the system of equations encoded $A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}$ is like asking what $\\mathbf{x}$ in the domain of $f$ is mapped into the fixed $\\mathbf{b}$ in the codomain.\n\n$$ A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b} \\iff f(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{b} $$\n\n## (Mathematical) Motivation\n\nWhy are these linear functions important?\n\nWe will answer this question in two ways: a zoom in version and a zoom out version (later)\n\n**Zoom in version:** The rule says something important about the map $f$, on the lhs we see an l.c. of elements of $\\mathbb{R}^n$, i.e., $\\nu\\bf{u}$ and $\\lambda \\bf{v}$ are mapped into $\\nu\\bf{u}+\\lambda\\bf{v}\\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. This vector in turn is mapped, now under $f$, into the element $f(\\nu\\bf{u}+\\lambda\\bf{v})\\in\\mathbb{R}^m$. On the rhs we see a l.c. of elements of $\\mathbb{R}^m$: $f (\\bf{u})$ is being combined with $f (\\bf{v})$ with the coefficients $\\nu$ and $\\lambda$.\n\n![](figs/linear_func.png)\n\nOn the picture we see a l.c. diagram-$(\\nu,\\lambda)$ on the left and another on the right whose coefficients are the same. These diagrams and all the other are what we can the connectivity structure of the vector space. Notice, the elements being combined are different - on the left we have $\\bf{u}$ with $n$ dimensions while $\\bf{u}'$ has $m$ dimensions.\n\nThe equality $f(\\nu \\bf{u}+\\lambda \\bf{v}) = \\nu f (\\bf{u}) + \\lambda f(\\bf{v})$ says the three points of diagram on the left are \"connected\" to a diagram on the right involving the same coefficients. As a result, the connection on the left is preserved because it is reproduced on the right. Its image under $f$ does not change.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Commentary\n\nAn example of a non-preserving function was the $\\square$ function whose behavior is diagrammatically akin to this:\n\n![](figs/not_linear.png)\n\nThe image of the l.c. diagram on the left does not have a corresponding l.c. diagram (with the same coefficients) on the right. Thus we say $\\square$ does not preserve the diagram during is mapping action.\n:::\n\n# Two important subspaces\n\nThe domain and codomain of a map $f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\overset{\\sim}{\\longrightarrow}\\mathbb{R}^m$ are defined by us when we introduce $f$ to the world. But within $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\mathbb{R}^m$ there are subspaces of great importance and which are determined not by us diretly, but indirectly by the operation $f$ we choose.\n\nThese two spaces are the range of $f$ also known as the image of the domain under $f$ and the kernel or subspace of $f$, also known as the zeros of the function - from high-school.\n\n## Kernel of a linear function\n\n::: {#def-kernel style=\"color:gray\"}\nLet $f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\overset{\\sim}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathbb{R}^m$, then the kernel or nullspace of $f$ is the subset of the domain $\\mathbb{R}^n$:\n\n$$\n\\ker f = \\{\\bf{u}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n\\,\\,|\\,\\,f(\\bf{u})=\\bf{0}\\}\n$$\n\nMoreover, it is in fact a subspace.\n:::\n\n### Example 1 (cont):\n\nThe kernel of $f(x)=ax$ is the zeros of the function:\n\n$$\n\\ker f = \\{x\\in \\mathbb{R}\\,\\,|\\,\\,ax =0\\}=\\{0\\}\n$$\n\nIt is just one point in the domain, geometrically where the line intercept the x-axis.\n\n### Example 2 (cont):\n\nReturning to $g(x)=(2x,x)$, its nullspace is the subspace:\n\n$$\n\\ker g = \\{x\\in \\mathbb{R}\\,\\,|\\,\\,(2x,x) =(0,0)\\}=\\{0\\}\n$$\n\nAgain, just one vector.\n\n### Example 3 (cont):\n\n$$\n\\ker \\pi = \\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}\\,\\,|\\,\\,\\pi(x,y)=x=0\\}=\\{(0,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\,|\\,\\, y\\in \\mathbb{R}\\}\n$$\n\n![](figs/ker_pi.png){width=\"326\"}\n\nAny vector along the subspace **\\[0y axis\\]** of the domain $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is always projected in the $0$ of the codomain. This vertical axis is the kernel of $\\pi$ (determined by $\\pi$ itself)\n\n### Example 4 (cont):\n\nThe kernel of $\\Phi(x,y)=(2x-y,x+y)$ is:\n\n$$\n\\ker \\Phi = \\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\,|\\,\\,(2x-y,x+y)=(0,0)\\}\n$$\n\nWe have to solve the system of equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n2x-y=0\\\\\nx+y=0\n\\end{cases}\n\\leftrightsquigarrow\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & -1\\\\\n1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx\\\\y\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0\\\\0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\leftrightsquigarrow\n\\begin{pmatrix}2 & -1 &\\bigm|0\\\\1 & 1 &\\bigm| 0\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nBy inspection, the columns are independent and thus the solution is $(0,0)$.\n\n### Example 5 (cont):\n\n$$\n\\ker \\Xi = \\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\,|\\,\\,(2x-2y,x-y)=(0,0)\\}\n$$\n\nThe corresponding system to solve is\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}2 & -2 &\\bigm|0\\\\1 & -1 &\\bigm| 0\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nwhose solution is $c(1,1)$. The kernel is the whole line along $(1,1)$.\n\n## Image of the domain (range of linear functions)\n\n::: {#def-range style=\"color:gray\"}\nLet $f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\overset{\\sim}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathbb{R}^m$, then the range of $f$ is the subset of the domain $\\mathbb{R}^m$:\n\n$$\nf(\\mathbb{R}^n) = \\{f(\\bf{u})\\in\\mathbb{R}^m\\,\\,|\\,\\,\\bf{u}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n\\}\n$$\n\nMoreover, it is also a subspace.\n:::\n\nThe range of $f$ can is hard to compute, the concept is what is most important here.\n\nHow do we compute the image of the domain?\n\n**Example 1 (cont):**\n\nIs it possible to indentify any element $y$ of the codomain $\\mathbb{R}$ by some label $x$ of the domain $\\mathbb{R}$? In other words, can we solve for $x$, the equation:\n\n$$\nax = y\n$$\n\ngiven an arbitrary $y$?\n\nAnswer is yes, the form of the element of the domain assigned to $y$ is $y/a$.\n\nWe conclude $f(\\mathbb{R})=\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Example 2 (cont):**\n\nIs there for every $(u,v)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ a corresponding element $x$ in the domain $\\mathbb{R}$? We answer by solving for $x$:\n\n$$\n(2x,x)=(u,v) \\implies \\begin{cases}2x=u\\\\x=v\\end{cases}\\implies \\begin{cases}x=u/2\\\\x=v\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe answer is no. We cannot choose $u,v$ arbitrarily and find an $x$, the system only has solution $x$ for specific pairs of $u,v$, namely those that lie along the line $y=x/2$.\n\nComputing the image of the domain is $f(\\mathbb{R})=[\\text{line with equation}\\,\\, y=x/2]$ we can see that it is a subset of the codomain $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and thus not everyone of its elements (those outside the line in question) are not assigned to some real $x$. The function is therefore not surjective.\n\n**Example 3 (cont):**\n\nThe codomain is $\\mathbb{R}$ is it true or false that every one of its elements has a corresponding $(x,y)$ living in the domain $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nLets solve for $(x,y)$ the equation:\n\n$$\n\\pi(x,y) = u\\implies x=u\n$$\n\nThere is indeed a solution for this equation, in fact many of them, of the form $(u,y)$ where $y$ is any real number.\n\nThe image of the domain under $\\pi$ is the same set as the codomain - $f(\\mathbb{R}^2)=\\mathbb{R}$ - and thus the function is surjective.\n\n**Example 4 (cont):**\n\nWe seek, given any $(u,y)$ of the codomain, the corresponding $(x,y)$ in the domain:\n\n$$\n\\Phi(x,y)=(u,v)\\implies \\begin{cases}2x-y=u\\\\x+y=v\\end{cases}\\implies\\begin{cases}x=(u+v)/3\\\\y=(2v-u)/3\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nAnother way to check this is to compute the image of the domain: $\\Phi(\\mathbb{R}^2)=\\mathbb{R}^2$, because the column of the matrix are independent. The $\\Phi$ function is surjective.\n\n**Example 5 (cont):**\n\nThe function $\\Xi$ maps $(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2$ into $(u,v)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2$. Is it true that every $(u,y)$ comes from some $(x,y)$? Lets solve the adequate equation:\n\n$$\n\\Xi(x,y)=(u,v) \\implies \\begin{cases}2x-2y=u\\\\x-y=v\\end{cases}\\implies \\begin{cases}x=u/2+y\\\\v=2u\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe equation $l_2$ tells us that we cannot choose any pair $u,v$ hence not every element of the codomain $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is assigned to some $(x,y)$.\n\nAnother way is to compute the image of the domain, notice as $x,y$ ranges in $\\mathbb{R}$, then $x-y$ ranges in $\\mathbb{R}$ as well, and thus the $\\Xi$ function is just like $\\Xi(\\spadesuit) = (2\\spadesuit,\\spadesuit)$, see example 2.\n\nThus\n\n$\\Xi(\\mathbb{R}^2) = [\\text{line with equation}\\,\\, y=x/2]$ again. And the function is not surjective.\n\n# Describing the type of mapping $f$\n\n1-1, sobrejective, bijective, etc, this is more important than the range. From Kernel we can evaluate the type of connectivity\n\nSince a function $f$ assigns elements $x$ to $y$ we can view it as analogous to assigning labels $y$ to the fruits $x$, hence $f$ allows us to distinguish elements in $X$ through the labels in $Y$. But how well were these labels assigned to the fruits? The ideal situation occurs when each $x$ has a unique label $y$, under this scenario we can retrieve the fruit from the label without any issue as they are unique; the worst case occurs when we have the same label for all $x$'s, its impossible to retrieve any fruits, under $f$ they are all the same. These are the two extremes of a spectrum of labeling, in between we have the intermediate cases where some fruits might have some common labels, examples of these three scenarios are shown in Fig.\n\n![](figs/onetoone_or_not.png)\n\nIt is precisely to evaluate the quality of the $f$ labeling that we introduce the words surjective, injective and bijective.\n\n::: {#def-onto_1to1 style=\"color:gray\"}\nLet $f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\overset{\\sim}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathbb{R}^m$ be a function, then we say:\n\n-   $[f\\,\\, \\text{is onto}]:= [\\forall \\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m :\\exists\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n : f(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{y}] = [\\text{Im}\\,\\,f =f(\\mathbb{R}^n)]$\n\n    Comment: every element in $\\mathbb{R}^m$ has a corresponding element in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\n-   $[f\\,\\, \\text{is 1-1}]:=[\\forall \\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}' \\in \\mathbb{R}^n:\\mathbf{x}\\not =\\mathbf{x}' \\implies f(\\mathbf{x}_1)\\not= f(\\mathbf{x}')]=[\\ker f =\\{\\mathbf{0}_{\\mathbb{R}^n}\\}]$\n\n    Comment: in other words, to say $f(\\mathbf{x})=f(\\mathbf{x}')$ implies $\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{x}'$\n\n-   $[f\\,\\, \\text{is bijective}]:=[f\\,\\, \\text{is 1-1 and onto}]$\n:::\n\nSummarizing, a surjective function makes use of all available labels, but doesn't guarantee that the labels are used one time only. Thus it might happen that apples and strawberries are given the same label. On the other hand, a 1-1 function guarantees that the labels only appear once, but does not guarantee that all available labels are used. A bijective function makes use of all labels one time.\n\n# Dimension Theorem\n\n::: {#thm-dimension style=\"color: gray\"}\nLet $f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\overset{\\sim}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathbb{R}^m$, then:\n\n$$\n\\dim \\mathbb{R}^n=n = \\dim \\ker f + \\dim \\text{Im}\\, f\n$$\n:::\n\n**Example 1 (cont):** $1 = \\dim \\{0\\} + \\dim \\{y/a\\,\\,|\\,\\, y\\in\\mathbb{R}\\}=0+1$ Note: only one vectors is needed to expand the image.\n\n**Example 2 (cont):** $1 = \\dim \\{0\\} + \\dim [\\text{line with equation}\\,\\, y=x/2]=0+1$ Note: A line only needs one basis vector!\n\n**Example 3 (cont):** $2 = \\dim\\{(0,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\,|\\,\\, y\\in\\mathbb{R}\\}+\\dim \\mathbb{R} = 1+1$\n\n**Example 4 (cont):** $2 = \\dim \\{(0,0)\\} +\\dim \\mathbb{R}^2=0+2$\n\n**Example 5 (cont):** $2 = \\dim \\{c(1,1)\\,\\,|\\,\\,c\\in\\mathbb{R}\\} + \\dim [\\text{line with equation} \\,\\, y=x/2]=1+1$\n\n![](images/clipboard-688989313.png)\n\nThis picture helps us also understand the following better:\n\n-   *A system of equations* $A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}$ *have one solution provided* $r=r^*=m$.

Now we enter a more conceptual part of the course and organize ideas.\n\n# The concept of a vector space\n\n*Suspend what you know:* We have been speaking about a vector space as being closed under linear combinations. However if we stop to think about it, we can only compute a linear combination provided we know how to multiply vectors by numbers and how to add vectors, see below:\n\n$$\n\\overbrace{\\alpha u}^\\text{number times a vector} + \\overbrace{\\beta v}^\\text{number times a vector}=\\underbrace{u'+v'}_\\text{sum of vectors}\n$$\n\nFor the moment we will consider these two operations in separate and also for the moment suspend how they are done in practice, thus, when we think about:\n\n$$\n(1,3)+(4,7)=?\\qquad 10(2,5)=?\n$$\n\nWe do not know how to do these operations.\n\nNow lets return to the idea of a vector space.\n\n*Today:* A set of things is just a list. Let us label those things as\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{V}=\\{v_1,v_2,\\dots,v_n\\}\n$$\n\nWhat can we do with the things in this set?\n\nWe can define a map, a map is a rule or sequence of operations that tell me how to assigns to each pair of elements in $\\mathbb{V}$ a new element in $\\mathbb{V}$. Right now, we are not thinking about a specific map, you can even imagine (if it helps you) that aliens choose the map, but did not told us what it is (except for that fact that they chose one.)\n\nAnother kind of map they decide to introduce, for which we do not know yet how it operates consists in assigning to each pairing of a real number and an element of $\\mathbb{V}$, another element of $\\mathbb{V}$.\n\nThe notion of map as we just described in words is described in mathematical notation as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n+ : \\mathbb{V}\\times\\mathbb{V} &\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{V}\\\\\n(u,v)&\\longmapsto u\\tilde{+}v\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\\cdot : \\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{V} &\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{V}\\\\(\\alpha,v)&\\longmapsto \\alpha\\cdot v\\end{align}\n$$\n\nThe $u+v$ is the symbol for the element in $\\mathbb{V}$ that corresponds to the pair $(u,v)$. And $\\alpha\\cdot v$ is the symbol for the element assigned to $(\\alpha,v)$.\n\nNow they disclose to us a few properties that their maps have:\n\n-   Commutative: $u+v=v+u$. \\[*You can flip the order*\\]\n\n-   Associative: $(u+v)+w=u+(v+w)$. \\[*You can shift the brackets*\\]\n\n-   Neutral element: There is a neutral element wrt to $+$: There is an element in $\\mathbf{V}$, call it $o$ so that for all $u\\in \\mathbb{V}$ we find $u+o=u$. \\[*This is not* $0$ *from the real numbers, it is the zero of* $\\mathbb{V}$*. To avoid confusion you can call* $o$ *as circle rather than zero.*\\]\n\n-   Inverse element: For every element $u$ there an element, which we denote by $-u$, that guarantees $u+(-u)=o$. \\[ $u-v$ is just a short notation for $u+(-v)$\\]\n\nThe next list of rules describe how the operations $+$ and $\\cdot$ interact when both present in a calculation, two of this rules are distributive rules:\n\n-   Associative: $\\alpha(\\beta u)=(\\alpha\\beta)v$\n\n-   Distributive I: $(\\alpha+\\beta)u = \\alpha u +\\beta u$\n\n-   Distributive II: $\\alpha (u +v) = \\alpha u + \\alpha v$\n\n-   Unitary: $1 u = u$\n\nWe do not know specifically how the assignments are made, the only thing we know is: whatever they are, they obey the rules above.\n\nA vector space is a triplet $(\\mathbb{V},+,\\cdot)$\n\nIts like describing someone: you can list all its characteristics, or just list the essential one. Here essential depends for what the description is useful for.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Commentary\n\nWhy is maps and these rules?

The rules above are the rules of common sense for l.c.\n:::\n\nWhat specific sets and $+$ and $\\cdot$ operations fit the profile above? Here are some examples:\n\n## Example 1 of a vector space\n\nThe set of all polynomials:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}=\\{\\dots+a_n x^n+a_{n-1} x^{n-1} +\\dots +a_1 x +a_0\\,\\,|\\,\\, a_i \\text{'s are real}\\}\n$$\n\nTogether with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}+ : \\mathbb{P}\\times\\mathbb{P} &\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{V}\\\\(p,q)&\\longmapsto (p+q)(x)=p(x)+q(x)\\end{align}\n$$\n\nHere, the $+$ sign between functions $p$ and $q$ manifests in practice as the summation $+$ of real numbers $p(x)$ and $q(x)$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\\cdot : \\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{P} &\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{V}\\\\(\\alpha,p)&\\longmapsto (\\alpha\\cdot p)(x):=\\alpha\\cdot p(x)\\end{align}\n$$\n\nThe multiplication between a real number and the function $p$ is understood in therms of the multiplication between the real number $\\alpha$ and $p(x)$.\n\nAll the rules above can be checked for this example.\n\nThe natural basis for this vector space is: $\\{1,x,x^2,\\dots\\}$\n\n## Example 2 of a vector space\n\nConsider the set:\n\n$\\mathbb{V} = \\{(x,y)\\,\\,|\\,\\, x,y\\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$\n\nAnd the maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n+ : \\mathbb{V}\\times\\mathbb{V} &\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{V}\\\\\n(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v})&\\longmapsto \\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{v} := (u_x,u_y)+(v_x,v_y)=(u_x+v_x,u_y+v_y)\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\\cdot : \\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{V} &\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{V}\\\\(\\alpha,\\mathbf{u})&\\longmapsto \\alpha\\cdot \\mathbf{u}:=(\\alpha u_x,\\alpha u_y)\\end{align}\n$$\n\nOnce again the summation of vectors is in practice the summation of numbers and the multiplication of a vector by a real number means the multiplication of its entries (real numbers) by the real number $\\alpha$.\n\nNotice that when I write $(u_x,u_y)+(v_x,v_y)$ one may wonder what it means, we know it is another element of $\\mathbf{V}$, but which one? To answer that we have to tell how the operation $+$ between two elements of $\\mathbb{V}$ actually maps. Whatever the way it maps, it must be consistent with the rules defined above. It turn out that to define this $+$ as doing $(u_x+v_x,u_y+v_y)$ (a plus between reals) is a good and useful choice.\n\nThe natural choice of basis for this vector space is: $\\{(1,0),(0,1)\\}$\n\n# Intuitive idea of structure of a vs (Retirar?)\n\nFor example let us define the summation and multiplication by a number.\n\nFor example take $\\mathbb{R}^2$, we know that:\n\n$$\n(1,3)+(0,1) = (1,4)\n$$\n\nTherefore, the vectors $(1,3)$ and $(0,1)$ are connected to $(1,4)$.\n\nWhen I multiply a vector by number:\n\n$$\n3(1,9) = (3,27)\n$$\n\nand as a result the vector $(1,9)$ is connected with $(3,27)$.\n\nA generic l.c. $\\alpha(1,3)+\\beta(0,1) = (\\alpha,3\\alpha+\\beta)$.

With this idea in mind, the system of equations encoded $A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}$ is like asking what $\\mathbf{x}$ in the domain of $f$ is mapped into the fixed $\\mathbf{b}$ in the codomain.\n\n$$ A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b} \\iff f(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{b} $$\n\n## (Mathematical) Motivation\n\nWhy are these linear functions important?\n\nWe will answer this question in two ways: a zoom in version and a zoom out version (later)\n\n**Zoom in version:** The rule says something important about the map $f$, on the lhs we see an l.c. of elements of $\\mathbb{R}^n$, i.e., $\\nu\\bf{u}$ and $\\lambda \\bf{v}$ are mapped into $\\nu\\bf{u}+\\lambda\\bf{v}\\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. This vector in turn is mapped, now under $f$, into the element $f(\\nu\\bf{u}+\\lambda\\bf{v})\\in\\mathbb{R}^m$. On the rhs we see a l.c. of elements of $\\mathbb{R}^m$: $f (\\bf{u})$ is being combined with $f (\\bf{v})$ with the coefficients $\\nu$ and $\\lambda$.\n\n![](figs/linear_func.png)\n\nOn the picture we see a l.c. diagram-$(\\nu,\\lambda)$ on the left and another on the right whose coefficients are the same. These diagrams and all the other are what we can the connectivity structure of the vector space. Notice, the elements being combined are different - on the left we have $\\bf{u}$ with $n$ dimensions while $\\bf{u}'$ has $m$ dimensions.\n\nThe equality $f(\\nu \\bf{u}+\\lambda \\bf{v}) = \\nu f (\\bf{u}) + \\lambda f(\\bf{v})$ says the three points of diagram on the left are \"connected\" to a diagram on the right involving the same coefficients. As a result, the connection on the left is preserved because it is reproduced on the right. Its image under $f$ does not change.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Commentary\n\nAn example of a non-preserving function was the $\\square$ function whose behavior is diagrammatically akin to this:\n\n![](figs/not_linear.png)\n\nThe image of the l.c. diagram on the left does not have a corresponding l.c. diagram (with the same coefficients) on the right.

The kernel is the whole line along $(1,1)$.\n\n## Image of the domain (range of linear functions)\n\n::: {#def-range style=\"color:gray\"}\nLet $f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\overset{\\sim}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathbb{R}^m$, then the range of $f$ is the subset of the domain $\\mathbb{R}^m$:\n\n$$\nf(\\mathbb{R}^n) = \\{f(\\bf{u})\\in\\mathbb{R}^m\\,\\,|\\,\\,\\bf{u}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n\\}\n$$\n\nMoreover, it is also a subspace.\n:::\n\nThe range of $f$ can is hard to compute, the concept is what is most important here.\n\nHow do we compute the image of the domain?\n\n**Example 1 (cont):**\n\nIs it possible to indentify any element $y$ of the codomain $\\mathbb{R}$ by some label $x$ of the domain $\\mathbb{R}$? In other words, can we solve for $x$, the equation:\n\n$$\nax = y\n$$\n\ngiven an arbitrary $y$?\n\nAnswer is yes, the form of the element of the domain assigned to $y$ is $y/a$.\n\nWe conclude $f(\\mathbb{R})=\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Example 2 (cont):**\n\nIs there for every $(u,v)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ a corresponding element $x$ in the domain $\\mathbb{R}$? We answer by solving for $x$:\n\n$$\n(2x,x)=(u,v) \\implies \\begin{cases}2x=u\\\\x=v\\end{cases}\\implies \\begin{cases}x=u/2\\\\x=v\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe answer is no. We cannot choose $u,v$ arbitrarily and find an $x$, the system only has solution $x$ for specific pairs of $u,v$, namely those that lie along the line $y=x/2$.\n\nComputing the image of the domain is $f(\\mathbb{R})=[\\text{line with equation}\\,\\, y=x/2]$ we can see that it is a subset of the codomain $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and thus not everyone of its elements (those outside the line in question) are not assigned to some real $x$. The function is therefore not surjective.\n\n**Example 3 (cont):**\n\nThe codomain is $\\mathbb{R}$ is it true or false that every one of its elements has a corresponding $(x,y)$ living in the domain $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nLets solve for $(x,y)$ the equation:\n\n$$\n\\pi(x,y) = u\\implies x=u\n$$\n\nThere is indeed a solution for this equation, in fact many of them, of the form $(u,y)$ where $y$ is any real number.\n\nThe image of the domain under $\\pi$ is the same set as the codomain - $f(\\mathbb{R}^2)=\\mathbb{R}$ - and thus the function is surjective.\n\n**Example 4 (cont):**\n\nWe seek, given any $(u,y)$ of the codomain, the corresponding $(x,y)$ in the domain:\n\n$$\n\\Phi(x,y)=(u,v)\\implies \\begin{cases}2x-y=u\\\\x+y=v\\end{cases}\\implies\\begin{cases}x=(u+v)/3\\\\y=(2v-u)/3\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nAnother way to check this is to compute the image of the domain: $\\Phi(\\mathbb{R}^2)=\\mathbb{R}^2$, because the column of the matrix are independent. The $\\Phi$ function is surjective.\n\n**Example 5 (cont):**\n\nThe function $\\Xi$ maps $(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2$ into $(u,v)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2$. Is it true that every $(u,y)$ comes from some $(x,y)$? Lets solve the adequate equation:\n\n$$\n\\Xi(x,y)=(u,v) \\implies \\begin{cases}2x-2y=u\\\\x-y=v\\end{cases}\\implies \\begin{cases}x=u/2+y\\\\v=2u\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe equation $l_2$ tells us that we cannot choose any pair $u,v$ hence not every element of the codomain $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is assigned to some $(x,y)$.\n\nAnother way is to compute the image of the domain, notice as $x,y$ ranges in $\\mathbb{R}$, then $x-y$ ranges in $\\mathbb{R}$ as well, and thus the $\\Xi$ function is just like $\\Xi(\\spadesuit) = (2\\spadesuit,\\spadesuit)$, see example 2.\n\nThus\n\n$\\Xi(\\mathbb{R}^2) = [\\text{line with equation}\\,\\, y=x/2]$ again. And the function is not surjective.\n\n# Describing the type of mapping $f$\n\n1-1, sobrejective, bijective, etc, this is more important than the range. From Kernel we can evaluate the type of connectivity\n\nSince a function $f$ assigns elements $x$ to $y$ we can view it as analogous to assigning labels $y$ to the fruits $x$, hence $f$ allows us to distinguish elements in $X$ through the labels in $Y$. But how well were these labels assigned to the fruits? The ideal situation occurs when each $x$ has a unique label $y$, under this scenario we can retrieve the fruit from the label without any issue as they are unique; the worst case occurs when we have the same label for all $x$'s, its impossible to retrieve any fruits, under $f$ they are all the same. These are the two extremes of a spectrum of labeling, in between we have the intermediate cases where some fruits might have some common labels, examples of these three scenarios are shown in Fig.\n\n![](figs/onetoone_or_not.png)\n\nIt is precisely to evaluate the quality of the $f$ labeling that we introduce the words surjective, injective and bijective.\n\n::: {#def-onto_1to1 style=\"color:gray\"}\nLet $f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\overset{\\sim}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathbb{R}^m$ be a function, then we say:\n\n-   $[f\\,\\, \\text{is onto}]:= [\\forall \\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m :\\exists\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n : f(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{y}] = [\\text{Im}\\,\\,f =f(\\mathbb{R}^n)]$\n\n    Comment: every element in $\\mathbb{R}^m$ has a corresponding element in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\n-   $[f\\,\\, \\text{is 1-1}]:=[\\forall \\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}' \\in \\mathbb{R}^n:\\mathbf{x}\\not =\\mathbf{x}' \\implies f(\\mathbf{x}_1)\\not= f(\\mathbf{x}')]=[\\ker f =\\{\\mathbf{0}_{\\mathbb{R}^n}\\}]$\n\n    Comment: in other words, to say $f(\\mathbf{x})=f(\\mathbf{x}')$ implies $\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{x}'$\n\n-   $[f\\,\\, \\text{is bijective}]:=[f\\,\\, \\text{is 1-1 and onto}]$\n:::\n\nSummarizing, a surjective function makes use of all available labels, but doesn't guarantee that the labels are used one time only. Thus it might happen that apples and strawberries are given the same label. On the other hand, a 1-1 function guarantees that the labels only appear once, but does not guarantee that all available labels are used. A bijective function makes use of all labels one time.\n\n# Dimension Theorem\n\n::: {#thm-dimension style=\"color: gray\"}\nLet $f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\overset{\\sim}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathbb{R}^m$, then:\n\n$$\n\\dim \\mathbb{R}^n=n = \\dim \\ker f + \\dim \\text{Im}\\, f\n$$\n:::\n\n**Example 1 (cont):** $1 = \\dim \\{0\\} + \\dim \\{y/a\\,\\,|\\,\\, y\\in\\mathbb{R}\\}=0+1$ Note: only one vectors is needed to expand the image.\n\n**Example 2 (cont):** $1 = \\dim \\{0\\} + \\dim [\\text{line with equation}\\,\\, y=x/2]=0+1$ Note: A line only needs one basis vector!\n\n**Example 3 (cont):** $2 = \\dim\\{(0,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\,|\\,\\, y\\in\\mathbb{R}\\}+\\dim \\mathbb{R} = 1+1$\n\n**Example 4 (cont):** $2 = \\dim \\{(0,0)\\} +\\dim \\mathbb{R}^2=0+2$\n\n**Example 5 (cont):** $2 = \\dim \\{c(1,1)\\,\\,|\\,\\,c\\in\\mathbb{R}\\} + \\dim [\\text{line with equation} \\,\\, y=x/2]=1+1$\n\n![](images/clipboard-688989313.png)\n\nThis picture helps us also understand the following better:\n\n-   *A system of equations* $A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}$ *have one solution provided* $r=r^*=m$.
