Thus, working out properties of the map $A$ tell us something about the map $f$. And by properties I mean: is $f$ 1-1? Onto? Bijective? We can answer these questions by asking them instead to $A$.\n\n## Example 1\n\nConsider two vector spaces whose dimensions are:\n\n$$ \\dim \\mathbb{V}=3 \\qquad \\dim\\mathbb{W}=1 $$\n\nwe do not know what are its elements, but still we label a basis they have as:\n\n$$ \\mathbf{B}=(v_1,v_2,v_3)\\qquad\\mathbf{C}=(w_1) $$\n\nthese are just labels, but they immediately tells us that elements of $\\mathbb{V}$ and $\\mathbb{W}$ can acquire the form:\n\n$$ v=\\mathbf{B} X  \\qquad X=\\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\\x_2\\\\x_3\\end{pmatrix} $$ {#eq-repre_v}\n\nand\n\n$$\n w=\\mathbf{C}Y \\qquad Y=\\begin{pmatrix}y_1\\end{pmatrix}\n$$ {#eq-repre_w}\n\nI want now to introduce a function $f:\\mathbb{V}\\overset{\\sim}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathbb{W}$, but rather than telling a formula for it (which would also require to provide a form for the elements of $\\mathbb{V}$ and $\\mathbb{W}$) , I decide just to provide the action of $f$ on the basis labels:\n\n$$ f(v_1)=f(v_3)=2w_1\\qquad f(v_2)=0w_1 $$\n\ni.e.\n\n$$ f(\\mathbf{B})=\\mathbf{C} A \\qquad A=\\begin{pmatrix}2& 0&2\\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThis is enough for us to be able to compute the action of $f$ on a generic $v\\in\\mathbb{V}$:\n\n$$ f(v)=\\mathbf{C}AX =\\begin{pmatrix} w_1\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}2& 0&2\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\\x_2\\\\x_3\\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nSince we have $f(v)\\in \\mathbb{W}$, we know from @eq-repre_w that $f(v)=y_1 w_1$, we conclude:\n\n$$ (y_1)=\\begin{pmatrix}2& 0&2\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\\x_2\\\\x_3\\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThis is $Y=AX$, mapping the $v\\in \\mathbb{V}$ represented wrt $\\mathbf{B}$ into a $f(v)$ represented wrt $\\mathbf{C}$.\n\nNotice we know how to map any vector even though we did not specify what is $\\mathbb{V}$, nor $\\mathbb{W}$ and neither the form of the basis elements of both, we only provided labels for them. Knowing how $f$ act on these labels was enough! The reason I am not providing specifics on these sets and on the form of $f$ is because, they are the bare minimum you need to compute maps; in practice if I have a concrete linear function and sets, I can just easily adapt the above line of reasoning.\n\n### The 4 subspaces of a matrix and their consequences\n\nWhat is the kernel of $f$? Adapting the definition to the present example we have to solve the problem of finding the nullspace of the matrix $(2,0,2)$:\n\n$$ AX_N=0 \\iff \\begin{pmatrix}2& 0&2\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x_{1N}\\\\x_{2N}\\\\x_{3N}\\end{pmatrix}=(0) $$\n\nSince we have one pivot on the first column and two dependent columns, we expect two dimensions.\n\nIsolating $Col_2$ by setting $y_N=1$ and $z_N=0$, the only answer is $x_N=0$, thus $(0,1,0)^\\intercal$ is in the nullspace.\n\nIsolating $Col_3$ by setting $y_N=0$ and $z_N=1$, we find $x_N=-1$, the second basis vector is $(-1,0,1)^\\intercal$.\n\nAny l.c. of these solutions is also mapped to $0$, thus:\n\n$$ N(A) = span \\{(0,1,0)^\\intercal,(-1,0,1)^\\intercal\\} $$\n\nNow we convert the nullspace into the kernel of $f$ by multiplying the elements of the set by $\\mathbf{B}$ and @eq-ker_f:\n\n$$ \\ker f = span \\{\\mathbf{B}(0,1,0)^\\intercal,\\mathbf{B}(-1,0,1)^\\intercal\\} $$\n\nThe image of $f$ is $f(\\mathbb{V})$ and we can get it from the column space of the matrix $A$.\n\nLooking closer at $AX$ we find:\n\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix}2& 0&2\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x_{1}\\\\x_{2}\\\\x_{3}\\end{pmatrix} $$only one independent column, the first one, thus the column space is just:\n\n$$ C(A)=span\\{(2)\\} $$\n\nAnd from @eq-im_f, the image of $f$ is:\n\n$$ f(\\mathbb{V})=span\\{2w_1\\} $$\n\nWe see that the kernel and image of $f$ are just analogous to the nullspace and column space of the matrix $(2,0,2)$.\n\n**Orthogonal spaces:** (Rowspace and left-nullspace) From the matrix $A$ we can define the row-space as\n\n$$ C(A^\\intercal)=span\\{(1,0,1)^\\intercal\\} $$\n\n\\[*Commentary:* when multiplied by $\\mathbf{B}$ gives us the image of $f$. Note that while rowspace and nullspace are orthogonal wrt $\\cdot_{\\mathbb{R}^n}$, the corresponding subspaces in $\\mathbb{V}$ need not be, since $\\{v_i\\}_{i=1,..,n}$ may not be orthogonal wrt $\\cdot_\\mathbb{V}$\\]\n\nWhile the left-nullspace is just\n\n$$ N(A^\\intercal)=\\{(0)\\} $$\n\nThe rowspace and nullspace break the domain $\\mathbb{R}^3$ into two subspaces, while the column space and codomain are equal:\n\n$$ \\mathbb{R}^3 = span\\{(1,0,1)^\\intercal\\}\\oplus span \\{(0,1,0)^\\intercal,(-1,0,1)^\\intercal\\}\\qquad \\mathbb{R} = \\mathbb{R}\\oplus\\{0\\} $$\n\nFrom this, the following picture tells us how one vector $X$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is mapped into $AX\\in\\mathbb{R}$\n\n![](figs/maps_yellow_vector.png){width=\"634\"}\n\nGiven these subspaces of the domain and codomain we can now focus on describing the kind of mapping that $A$ does and turn that $f$ does. On the picture we see a vector $X$ being decomposed into its parts, one in the nullspace and another in the row space:\n\n$$ X=X_{R}+X_{N} $$\n\nThe $X_N$ is mapped by this $A$ into $0$, and $X_R$ is mapped into $AX_R$, thus we can write $AX=AX_R$ for all $X\\in \\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nFor each $X_R$ in the rowspace we can any add any vector of the null space, the image is always $AX_R$. Therefore this is not a 1-1 function.\n\nBut is it onto? For any element $Y$ of $\\mathbb{R}$ can we find a $X$, such that $AX=Y$ ? I.e. are there always solution $x_1$ and $x_3$ such that\n\n$$ y_1=2x_1+2x_3 $$\n\nfor any $y_1$ we choose from $\\mathbb{R}$? The answer is yes. \\[Another way to look at this is to notice the $N(A^\\intercal)=\\{0\\}$\\].\n\nThus $A$ is onto and so is $f$.\n\nAs a consequence we conclude that any equation\n\n$$ f(v)=w $$\n\n(given a $w$) always has solution, in fact has an infinite number of solutions, thanks to the fact that the nullspace is not just $0$.\n\nAnother way to put this, $f$ has no inverse, however in its place we can define a fiber (a set) as follows:\n\n$$ f^{-1}(w)=\\{v\\in\\mathbb{V}\\,\\,|\\,\\,f(v)=w\\} $$\n\nTo compute this requires solving an already known to us problem $AX=Y$! This is what we have been doing in the beginning of the course.\n\n## Example 2\n\nConsider two vector spaces $\\mathbb{V}$ and $\\mathbb{W}$ and the following action on a basis:\n\n$$ \\begin{align} f(v_1)&=w_1+2w_2+3w_3\\\\ f(v_2)&=2w_1+4w_2+6w_3\\\\ f(v_3)&=2w_1+6w_2+8w_3\\\\ f(v_4)&=2w_1+8w_2+10w_3 \\end{align} $$\n\ni.e.\n\n$$ f(\\mathbf{B})=\\mathbf{C}A,\\qquad A=\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\2 & 4 & 6 & 8 \\\\3 & 6 & 8 & 10 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe action of $f$ on some generic element of $\\mathbb{V}$\n\n$$ v=\\mathbf{B}X\\qquad X=\\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\\x_2\\\\x_3\\\\x_4\\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nis:\n\n$$ f(v)=\\mathbf{C}AX=\\begin{pmatrix}w_1 & w_2 & w_3\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\2 & 4 & 6 & 8 \\\\3 & 6 & 8 & 10 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\\x_2\\\\x_3\\\\x_4\\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nAnd since:\n\n$$ f(v)=\\mathbf{C} Y \\qquad Y=\\begin{pmatrix}y_1\\\\y_2\\\\y_3\\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nwe conclude that:\n\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix}y_1\\\\y_2\\\\y_3\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\2 & 4 & 6 & 8 \\\\3 & 6 & 8 & 10 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\\x_2\\\\x_3\\\\x_4\\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe nullspace of $A$ is (we already computed this before, here):\n\n$$ N(A)=span\\{\\begin{pmatrix}-2\\\\1\\\\0\\\\0 \\end{pmatrix},\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\0\\\\-2\\\\1 \\end{pmatrix}\\} $$\n\nThe image of $f$ is computed from the $C(A)$, which is:\n\n$$ C(A) =span\\{\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\2\\\\3\\end{pmatrix},\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\6\\\\8\\end{pmatrix}\\}  $$\n\n**The orthogonal spaces:** (rowspace and left-nullspace) Recall the rowspace and left nullspace are orthogonal to these and have the following dimensions:\n\n$$ C(A^\\intercal)=span\\{(1,2,2,2)^\\intercal,(2,4,6,8)^\\intercal\\} \\qquad N(A^\\intercal)=span\\{(-1,-1,1)^\\intercal\\} $$\n\n![](figs/maps_fav_matrix.png)\n\nLooking at the diagram, any $X$, can be broken into two parts:\n\n$$ X=X_R+X_N $$\n\nAny $Y$ can also be broken into:\n\n$$ Y=Y_C+Y_{LN} $$\n\nThe matrix $A$ maps any $X$ into the $C(A)$, the $N(A^\\intercal)$ is never reached. This means that for any $Y$ with components in the left null space the equation:\n\n$$ AX=Y $$\n\nhas no solution.\n\nAny $Y$ living exclusively in the column space has a fiber of elements of the form $X_R+X_N$, for a fixed $X_R$ and $X_N$ ranging over the entire two dimensional $N(A)$. \\[*Comment:* This $X_R$ may or not be the particular solution we find when solving a system of equation, see here.\\]\n\nEvidently, this function is neither 1-1, nor onto, and no inverse (except in the sense of fiber) exists.\n\n## Example 3\n\nThe map:\n\n$$ \\begin{align} f:\\mathbb{V}&\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{W}\\\\ v&\\longmapsto f(v)  \\end{align} $$\n\ncan be specified wrt the bases:\n\n$$ \\mathbf{B}=\\begin{pmatrix}v_1 & v_2 & v_3\\end{pmatrix} \\qquad \\mathbf{C}=\\begin{pmatrix}w_1 & w_2 & w_3\\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nby introducing the matrix:\n\n$$ A=\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & -1 \\\\2 & -1& 2 \\\\1 & 2 & -1\\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThus $f(v)$ acquires the form:\n\n$$ f(v)=\\mathbf{C}AX \\qquad v=\\mathbf{B}X \\qquad X=\\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\\x_2\\\\x_3\\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe map between entries of $v$ wrt $\\mathbf{B}$ and the entries of $f(v)$ wrt $\\mathbf{C}$ is the equation:\n\n$$ Y=AX $$\n\nFor which we can get the nullspace and column space.\n\n$$ N(A)=\\{(0,0,0)^\\intercal\\} \\qquad C(A)=\\mathbb{R}^3 $$\n\njust like we computed before.\n\n![](figs/map_fc_full_rank.png){width=\"587\"}\n\nThere is only one solution. It is 1-1 and surjective. There is inverse.\n\n## Example 4:\n\n$$ \\begin{align} f:\\mathbb{R}^3&\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^3\\\\ \\mathbf{x}&\\longmapsto f(\\mathbf{x}):=A\\mathbf{x}  \\end{align} $$\n\nwith\n\n$$ A=\\begin{pmatrix}2 & -1 \\\\2 & 1 \\\\2 & 1\\end{pmatrix}  $$\n\nThe four spaces were already computed before, here is a diagram:\n\n![](figs/map_no_sol.png){width=\"533\"}\n\nIf $b$ vector is outside column space them there is no solution! Not surjective.\n\n## (Mathematical) Motivation: Linear Maps are Structure preserving maps. Whaaaat?\n\nWhy are these linear functions important?\n\nThe linearity rule says something important about the map $f$, on the left side of the picture we see a l.c. of elements of $\\mathbb{V}$, i.e., $\\nu u$ and $\\lambda v$ are mapped into $\\nu u+\\lambda v\\in \\mathbb{V}$. This vector in turn is mapped now, under $f$, into the element $f(\\nu u+\\lambda v)\\in\\mathbb{W}$, see the right side of the picture. Also on the right side we see a l.c. of elements of $\\mathbb{W}$, the element $f (u)=:u'$ is being combined with the element $f (v)=:v'$ with the coefficients $\\nu$ and $\\lambda$.\n\n![](figs/linear_func.png){width=\"618\"}\n\nOn the picture we see a l.c. diagram-$(\\nu,\\lambda)$ on the left and another on the right whose coefficients are the same. These diagrams and all the other I did not draw are what we call the connectivity structure of the vector space. Notice, on the left we see the domain of $f$ and on the right the codomain.\n\nThe equality $f(\\nu u+\\lambda v) = \\nu f (u) + \\lambda f(v)$ for coefficients $\\nu$ and $\\lambda$ says the three points of diagram on the left are \"connected\" to a diagram on the right involving the these same coefficients. The image of the diagram-$(\\nu,\\lambda)$ on the domain under $f$ does not change and is reproduced on the codomain.\n\nLets use the $f$ from example 1 to illustrate this idea:\n\nIf we use two numbers $\\nu$ and $\\lambda$ (eg. $\\nu=\\lambda=1$) to linear combine two vectors of the row space we connected two elements of row space with a third element of the rowspace. This is a concrete example of the diagram on the left side of the picture above.\n\nActing with $f$ on the these three we obtain three vectors, which are also connect by a l.c. with the same coefficients (eg. $\\nu=\\lambda=1$ we used before).\n\n![](figs/map_of_lc.png){width=\"378\"}\n\nHence the connectivity we built on the rowspace (=subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^3$) we reconstituted on the column space.\n\nNow add to each of the chosen vectors in the rowspace the whole nullspace, then any linear combination of vectors of two *given* planes yield *always* a vector in the *same* third plane (eg. combine any dark orange with orange vector and that gives you always a red vector). This is the structure (of connectivity) of the domain. And since the function is linear, these diagrams are replicated in the column space; a light green vector combined with a green vectors yields the same dark green vector.\n\n![](figs/planes_map.png)\n\n::: callout-note\n# Comentary\n\nAn example of a non-preserving function is the $\\square$ function\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\\square:\\mathbb{R}^2&\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2\\\\ (x,y)&\\longmapsto \\square(x,y):=(2x^2,y)\\end{align}\n$$\n\nwhose behavior is diagrammatically akin to this:\n\n![](figs/not_linear.png){width=\"658\"}\n\nThe image of the l.c. diagram on the left does not have a corresponding l.c. diagram (with the same coefficients) on the right. Thus we say $\\square$ does not preserve the diagram during is mapping action.\n:::\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Mapping properties of $f$\n\nThe way $f$ maps vectors is analogous to the way $A$ maps column vectors.

This means that for any $Y$ with components in the left null space the equation:\n\n$$ AX=Y $$\n\nhas no solution.\n\nAny $Y$ living exclusively in the column space has a fiber of elements of the form $X_R+X_N$, for a fixed $X_R$ and $X_N$ ranging over the entire two dimensional $N(A)$. \\[*Comment:* This $X_R$ may or not be the particular solution we find when solving a system of equation, see here.\\]\n\nEvidently, this function is neither 1-1, nor onto, and no inverse (except in the sense of fiber) exists.\n\n## Example 3\n\nThe map:\n\n$$ \\begin{align} f:\\mathbb{V}&\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{W}\\\\ v&\\longmapsto f(v)  \\end{align} $$\n\ncan be specified wrt the bases:\n\n$$ \\mathbf{B}=\\begin{pmatrix}v_1 & v_2 & v_3\\end{pmatrix} \\qquad \\mathbf{C}=\\begin{pmatrix}w_1 & w_2 & w_3\\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nby introducing the matrix:\n\n$$ A=\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & -1 \\\\2 & -1& 2 \\\\1 & 2 & -1\\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThus $f(v)$ acquires the form:\n\n$$ f(v)=\\mathbf{C}AX \\qquad v=\\mathbf{B}X \\qquad X=\\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\\x_2\\\\x_3\\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe map between entries of $v$ wrt $\\mathbf{B}$ and the entries of $f(v)$ wrt $\\mathbf{C}$ is the equation:\n\n$$ Y=AX $$\n\nFor which we can get the nullspace and column space.\n\n$$ N(A)=\\{(0,0,0)^\\intercal\\} \\qquad C(A)=\\mathbb{R}^3 $$\n\njust like we computed before.\n\n![](figs/map_fc_full_rank.png){width=\"587\"}\n\nThere is only one solution. It is 1-1 and surjective. There is inverse.\n\n## Example 4:\n\n$$ \\begin{align} f:\\mathbb{R}^3&\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^3\\\\ \\mathbf{x}&\\longmapsto f(\\mathbf{x}):=A\\mathbf{x}  \\end{align} $$\n\nwith\n\n$$ A=\\begin{pmatrix}2 & -1 \\\\2 & 1 \\\\2 & 1\\end{pmatrix}  $$\n\nThe four spaces were already computed before, here is a diagram:\n\n![](figs/map_no_sol.png){width=\"533\"}\n\nIf $b$ vector is outside column space them there is no solution! Not surjective.\n\n## (Mathematical) Motivation: Linear Maps are Structure preserving maps. Whaaaat?\n\nWhy are these linear functions important?\n\nThe linearity rule says something important about the map $f$, on the left side of the picture we see a l.c. of elements of $\\mathbb{V}$, i.e., $\\nu u$ and $\\lambda v$ are mapped into $\\nu u+\\lambda v\\in \\mathbb{V}$. This vector in turn is mapped now, under $f$, into the element $f(\\nu u+\\lambda v)\\in\\mathbb{W}$, see the right side of the picture. Also on the right side we see a l.c. of elements of $\\mathbb{W}$, the element $f (u)=:u'$ is being combined with the element $f (v)=:v'$ with the coefficients $\\nu$ and $\\lambda$.\n\n![](figs/linear_func.png){width=\"618\"}\n\nOn the picture we see a l.c. diagram-$(\\nu,\\lambda)$ on the left and another on the right whose coefficients are the same. These diagrams and all the other I did not draw are what we call the connectivity structure of the vector space. Notice, on the left we see the domain of $f$ and on the right the codomain.\n\nThe equality $f(\\nu u+\\lambda v) = \\nu f (u) + \\lambda f(v)$ for coefficients $\\nu$ and $\\lambda$ says the three points of diagram on the left are \"connected\" to a diagram on the right involving the these same coefficients. The image of the diagram-$(\\nu,\\lambda)$ on the domain under $f$ does not change and is reproduced on the codomain.\n\nLets use the $f$ from example 1 to illustrate this idea:\n\nIf we use two numbers $\\nu$ and $\\lambda$ (eg. $\\nu=\\lambda=1$) to linear combine two vectors of the row space we connected two elements of row space with a third element of the rowspace. This is a concrete example of the diagram on the left side of the picture above.\n\nActing with $f$ on the these three we obtain three vectors, which are also connect by a l.c. with the same coefficients (eg. $\\nu=\\lambda=1$ we used before).\n\n![](figs/map_of_lc.png){width=\"378\"}\n\nHence the connectivity we built on the rowspace (=subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^3$) we reconstituted on the column space.\n\nNow add to each of the chosen vectors in the rowspace the whole nullspace, then any linear combination of vectors of two *given* planes yield *always* a vector in the *same* third plane (eg. combine any dark orange with orange vector and that gives you always a red vector). This is the structure (of connectivity) of the domain. And since the function is linear, these diagrams are replicated in the column space; a light green vector combined with a green vectors yields the same dark green vector.\n\n![](figs/planes_map.png)\n\n::: callout-note\n# Comentary\n\nAn example of a non-preserving function is the $\\square$ function\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\\square:\\mathbb{R}^2&\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2\\\\ (x,y)&\\longmapsto \\square(x,y):=(2x^2,y)\\end{align}\n$$\n\nwhose behavior is diagrammatically akin to this:\n\n![](figs/not_linear.png){width=\"658\"}\n\nThe image of the l.c. diagram on the left does not have a corresponding l.c. diagram (with the same coefficients) on the right. Thus we say $\\square$ does not preserve the diagram during is mapping
